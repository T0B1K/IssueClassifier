But as far as I can see, the `ModifyGraphWithDelegate` function is not present in lite/c (why? It would be very helpful), even though it has the concept of delegates;\r\n2. https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/gpu_advanced#android_cc : suggests a build command that generates a 60MB shared library... I don't see any benefit in giving such suggestion, since other commands listed in other pages will generate properly optimized binaries;\r\n3. https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/gpu_advanced#android_cc : building on (2.), I'm also under the impression that building the delegate as a separate shared lib would not be the best option for minimizing the overall size - in this case, a target for building the delegate + libtensorflowlite together would be highly appreciated, at least as a documentation snippet (not to mention prebuilt binaries, which are referred by the team as \"coming soon\" in several not-so-recent issue comments);\r\n3. https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/gpu_advanced#inputoutput_buffers : suggests the use of `GpuDelegate` which, as far as I understand comes from `lite/delegates/gpu/gl_delegate.h` and as such is deprecated. A big notice in the source code warns to migrate to the new implementation before the end of 2019, so it probably shouldn't be in documentation;\r\n4. https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/gpu_advanced#inputoutput_buffers : \r\nWhile a replacement exists (`lite/delegates/gpu/delegate.h`), it does not have any `bindGlBufferToTensor()` function, and it is not clear how to achieve the same thing with the new delegate. There are several unanswered questions on SO about this;\r\n5. https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/gpu_advanced#inputoutput_buffers : the example uses a SSBO, however the delegate seems to support [textures as well?](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/gpu/gl_delegate.h#L53-L57) If this can be a different way to send initial input, it would be nice to have it documented;\r\n\r\nIt is hard for us to plan the adoption of TFLite without a clear view over what you have, or at least where you're heading. For example, I'm especially interested in using GL buffers as input (sounds like a game changer), but I have no clue about what's the state of this in TFLite. Same with using delegates in lite/c, the abstraction is there but `ModifyGraphWithDelegate` is not. So doc fixes apart, could we have a very brief description of where TFLite + GPU/delegates is headed and what's coming in the next couple of months, so that people can decide if it meets their needs and plan accordingly? \r\n\r\nI understand that some of these APIs are marked as experimental and I really appreciate your work.

This seems out of place and disrupts the developer workflow. \r\n\r\nNext was step 3 to initiate eager execution.\r\n\ud83d\ude11Without a baseline on what EE is, I felt required to read the eager execution page before I could move forward. It\u2019s frustrating when a developer guide links out to other documentation, or I feel compelled to read the other pages, because it causes disruption in grasping one concept at a time. This frustration can be a \"drop off\" point for developers trying to onboard Tensorflow.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6283150/75946528-35227000-5e52-11ea-9312-09405b8e3043.png)\r\n\r\nEnable_V2_Behavior is the command run after asking the user to enable eager execution.

I am 5 steps down this getting started guide, and then sent to another page that will reasonably take 4+ focused hours to additionally complete. This is very frustrating when I am trying to just get an overview of tensorflow datasets.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\ude00Step 5 does a great job here showing an example directly in relation to the above paragraph on versioning! I\u2019m delighted and can move on without needing to read the hyperlink. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6283150/75946588-54b99880-5e52-11ea-8e80-6ec1f06b684e.png)\r\n\r\n\ud83d\ude11Step 7 is confusing since it states we can achieve the same output using the DatasetBuilder, but when you run the test it only outputs the ds_train variable, as opposed to building the graph. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6283150/75946599-5be0a680-5e52-11ea-9cfd-37520abadae3.png)\r\n\r\n### What should happen?\r\n\r\nI have organized answers to the above friction points in the following groupings:\r\n\r\n**Tensorflow Installation**\r\nTo identify which version of Tensorflow I installed I ran a grep command in the code lab to output the following:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6283150/75946716-bd087a00-5e52-11ea-95d3-c13f68c33df9.png)\r\n\r\nHaving something like this ^ output during installation will help users know what is downloaded and executed in the install command. \r\n\r\n**Eager Execution**\r\n\r\nA simple way to clarify what eager execution is to write a one sentence definition in the guide. For example:\r\n\r\n\"TensorFlow's eager execution is an imperative programming environment that evaluates operations immediately, without building graphs: operations return concrete values instead of constructing a computational graph to run later.\"\r\n\r\nThis way I have a quick understanding and don\u2019t feel compelled to read the linked page which is a very long document! :)\r\nI liken this to applications having a tooltip in consumer facing applications. Adding in quick non intrusive explanations to Respect the User keep your users engaged and on the same page. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, adding in the following message to define the command, \"enable_v2_behavior\", would help clarify that Eager Execution is enabled by default tensorflow 2. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6283150/75946725-c560b500-5e52-11ea-9229-96f8b71dc895.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Linking to the official guide for Tensorflow Datasets**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6283150/75946747-d3163a80-5e52-11ea-820b-a43d13bbbe76.png)\r\n\r\nWe need to Respect the User, and provide simplicity when on boarding someone new to TFDS. They have invested time to make it down to the 5th step. If it is imperative the user get a baseline understanding of the Tensorflow API first, then we should put the disclaimer at the top of the overview to go read the guide first before continuing. \r\n\r\nIf it is not necessary, then we should summarize the API guide into 3-5 concise pillars of information that is required for the user to understand the rest of the overview. When the user completes the overview, we can encourage them to go deeper and read the rest of the guide. Similarly, an analogy is when loading a website you respect the user by building a light-weight modern site. Performant sites lazy load in images when they are needed to improve performance and minimize how much data your user needs to download, we should apply the same principles to information.  \r\n\r\n**DatasetBuilder**\r\nWhen introducing in the DatasetBuilder we should place this information right after Step 5 (calling .load), to show the two ways to load in datasets side by side. This way the user does not need to scroll back up the documentation and read before Step 6 (plotting the dataset). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},

But I'm sure why those two cases have same accuracy.\r\n\r\nThose behavior let me confused.\r\n\r\nBefore applying pre-trained model, I have to which normalization method should be applied.\r\n\r\nAfter reading the source code, I found that those applications are import from `keras_application` in `tensorflow`.\r\n\r\n[keras-applications](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-applications)\r\n\r\n[weight download](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI didn't test other models, such as `ResNet50V2`, `InceptionV3` and `Xception` because their input size are `299` instead of `244` and this is a time consuming task.\r\n\r\nHowever, anyone can modify the test case and do the benchmark.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBecause of licence issue for ImageNet, I can't provide imagenet in public.\r\n\r\nBut the following is the minimal test case:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0\r\n# pip pandas\r\n#%%\r\nimport time\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport tensorflow as tf\r\n\r\nfrom glob import glob\r\n\r\n#%%\r\n# input image dimensions\r\nimg_h = 224\r\nimg_w = 224\r\nchannels = 3\r\n\r\n# information for dataset\r\ndataset_path = \"dataset-imagenet/\"\r\nnum_classes = 1000\r\nnum_testing = 50000\r\n\r\n#%%\r\nclass DataGenerator:\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, dataframe, batch_size, run_aug = True):\r\n\r\n        self.total_len  = len(dataframe.index)\r\n        self.batch_size = batch_size\r\n        self.run_aug = run_aug\r\n        self.dataframe  = dataframe\r\n        self.on_epoch_end()\r\n\r\n    def __build_pipeline(self, file_path, labelY):\r\n\r\n        #

For int8 inputs, the developer will typically need to subtract 128 from each value, but this knowledge (and how the offset value is calculated) is not documented.

{"text": "This is inspired by the discussion in https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancementproposals/pull/25.\r\n\r\nNumPy defines an ``array`` protocol that allows developers to implement classes that can be converted to an array by calling ``np.asarray()`` . That makes it easy to have a common interface between libraries and it's heavily used by pandas and sklearn.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have a similar protocol for converting something to a pandas ``DataFrame``. The goal would be to allow users to pass other data structures to libraries that expect a dataframe, say seaborn, as long as the data structures allow conversion to ``pd.DataFrame``.\r\n\r\nA workaround is for the developer of the new datastructure to provide an ``.asframe`` method, but that creates friction and requires the users to know what data type a particular library or function expects. If instead the developer of the datastructure can declare that conversion to a dataframe is possible, the library author (say seaborn) can request conversion to dataframe in a unified manner.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of this is probably pretty simple as it requires \"only\" a special case in ``pd.DataFrame.init``. The main work is probably in adding it to developer documentation and publicizing it correctly.\r\n\r\ncc @jorisvandenbossche "},

If we needed to, we could add support for reading a new `curlexample` value, adjacent to `example`, to the OpenAPI data in `zulip.yaml`, that has the example value to be used in the curl example for that parameter; but I don't think that should be required; it should be fine to have the `curl` example use the same example strings we use in the code.  \r\n* We add a function constructcurlexample(authemail, authapikey), with code this:\r\n```\r\ncurlfirstline = [\"curl\"] + curlmethodarguments(httpmethod)\r\nif authenticationrequired:\r\n    curlauthline = [\"-u\", \"%s:%s\" % (authemail, authapikey)]\r\nfor param, examplevalue in openapiexampleparams:\r\n    curlarguments += formatcurlargument(paramname, examplevalue)\r\nreturn curlfirstline, curlauthline, curlarguments\r\n```\r\n* We add another function, e.g. `rendercurlexample(endpoint)` that calls `constructcurlexample(\"BOTEMAILADDRESS\", ...)` and renders the nicely line-wrapped curl examples into the markdown file.\r\n* And we extend `tools/test-api` to have a loop that actually calls the curl example from the `constructcurlexample` (using `subprocess`) against the test server and checks it gets a 200 response.\r\n* We then convert the endpoints to use this new `rendercurlexample` system; we'll probably want to do this as one commit per endpoint because we may be fixing things in those individual endpoints, and the endpoints should be independent of each other (so it'll be easy to merge the easy ones fast and then revisit the rest).\r\n"},
{"text": "Something that's incredibly valuable in maintaining API documentation is making sure that we keep it up to date as the API changes.

There's a bunch of TODOs remaining to make this system really nice and have it add more coverage of possible bugs (I've marked the ones with an explicit TODO comment in the test, below):\r\n\r\n* [x] Not all arguments are intended to be documented (e.g. there's backwards compatibility, etc.).  We should add an option to `REQ` with a name like `intentionallyundocumented=True` that causes it to not add the argument to the `argumentsmap` data structure. (and thus not to considered for whether we've documented all arguments that should be documented in our test).  This should let us remove a bunch of things from `BUGGYDOCUMENTATIONENDPOINTS` that aren't actually buggy, they just have arguments we don't want to document (e.g. because they're old legacy things).\r\n* [ ] Remove other things from `BUGGYDOCUMENTATIONENDPOINTS` that are there just because we added an argument and didn't update the documentation when we did so.  E.g. https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/11136.\r\n* [x] TODO: Figure out a way to handle this matching between the OpenAPI format for parameters and the `urls.py` format: `/messages/{messageid} <-> r'^messages/(?P<messageid>[0-9]+)$'`.  We might want to handle this by having a loop over all OpenAPI endpoints in addition to our existing loop over all `urls.py` endpoints, because doing so would allow us to also verify that every endpoint in the OpenAPI codebase is being successfully matched to the corresponding actual code.\r\n* [x] TODO: Add support for using this syntax supported by `restdispatch`: `{'POST': ('zerver.views.report.reporterror', {'intentionallyundocumented'})}),` to mark in the `urls.py` which endpoints we expect to never have public API documentation (e.g. because they're used only internally by the webapp codebase).\r\n* [x] TODO: This is lower priority than the main issue, but it'd be really cool to cross-validate the types declared in OpenAPI against the types declared in `REQ` (via the `validator` parameter).  We may not be able to do this always, but 95% of the time it's `checkint` or `checkstr` or `checkdict`, and we can certainly map those to the expected type.\r\n\r\nOur \"writing views\" developer tutorial is good reading prior to working on this, as are https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation/api.html and https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation/openapi.html."},

{"text": "Zulip has a pretty well-designed API, with a lot of good properties, but it's documentation is incomplete. \r\n The overall goal is to fully document the Zulip API on https://zulipchat.com/api, so that it's easy both for Zulip app developers (mobile, terminal, etc.) and people building custom integrations to understand how to use Zulip's API.  We have documented a few dozen endpoints, but there are many missing.  https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation/api.html is our documentation on how that documentation works (thought it is somewhat out of date, in that we are migrating to using the OpenAPI format file `zerver/openapi/zulip.yaml` for some of the things like argument definitions that used to have a separate `fixtures` file).  Our general philosophy is to build a system that can be extensively unit-tested, so that we can ensure the documentation stays up-to-date as we expand and adjust the Zulip API .  Some good tasks in this area include:\r\n* [ ] Document a few endpoints.  Read 69da22d998c6f5f56931c8449f441b3fc114d59f as a recently added endpoint to refer to.  I've noted a few that seem like good starter items here.\r\n   * [ ] Document messages/${messageId}/reactions, the endpoint for adding emoji reactions\r\n   * [x] Work through the \"user groups\" endpoints mentioned below\r\n* [ ] Contribute to https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/12521, which has a bunch of coding tasks\r\n* [ ] Once one has done a few, update `docs/documentation/api.md` to correct the parts that are out of date.

Further, it should be just getting these data from `/register` with the right `eventtypes` value, so it's probably a mobile bug if we're accessing these:\r\n* [x] realm/emoji\r\n* [x] realm/filters\r\n(Unless I'm wrong and the app supports managing user groups somewhere secret?)\r\n* [x] usergroups/create\r\n* [x] usergroups/${id}\r\n* [ ] usergroups/${id}/members\r\n* [x] users/me/usergroups\r\n\r\nSame story with these stream settings/deactivation (though I could imagine changing these):\r\n* [x] streams/${id} -- does the app actually support administering streams this way? \r\nUser stream settings (color, notification settings, muted topics; does the app support administering these?): \r\n* [ ] users/me/subscriptions/mutedtopics\r\n* [x] users/me/subscriptions/properties\r\n\r\nAnd these user-level settings:\r\n* [ ] users/me/alertwords\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis endpoint is mostly just for mobile/desktop to get organization icon, but has some use beyond mobile/desktop:\r\n* [x] serversettings\r\n\r\nThese are used only by mobile, so potentially lower priority for main API docs:\r\n* [x] devfetchapikey\r\n* [ ] devlistusers\r\n* [ ] fetchapikey\r\n* [ ] users/me/androidgcmregid\r\n* [ ] users/me/apnsdevicetoken\r\n\r\nAlready documented, I think (unless it's a different method):\r\n* [x] events\r\n* [x] register (Ignoring documentation of the full data format, which is its own issue)\r\n* [x] messages\r\n* [x] messages/${id}\r\n* [x] messages/${messageId}\r\n* [x] users/me/${streamId}/topics\r\n* [x] users/me/subscriptions\r\n* [x] streams\r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\n"},

It should be explained in the documentation that the option id is the value and that the value is not a real value but rather, just an automatic id to identify options. I think that Value is an ambiguous name for an automatic identifier.\r\n"},

{"text": "When replacing `<img>` tags with `<amp-img>` tags is fraught with a specific type of mistake. `<img>` tags are void tags in HTML5, meaning that they are self-closing. `<amp-img>` cannot be made to be self-closing without changing a browser's HTML parser.\n\nChanging `<img ...>` to `<amp-img ...>` is a mistake.\nChanging `<img ...>` to `<amp-img ...></amp-img ...>` is correct.\n\nThe mistake may not cause rendering issues in most cases, but can cause them in some subtle cases, where CSS depends on the DOM structure or in cases like `<amp-live-list>` children as described [here](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/4074). Since this is very subtle, it could easily go unnoticed. We can imagine hypothetical cases where this would result in a broken looking document, but we haven't actually spotted any in the wild yet.\n\nValidating that `<amp-img>` tags are followed by `</amp-img>` is not feasible at this stage due to the large fallout.\n\nAfter discussing this with @powdercloud, we came up with two suggested recommendations:\n1. Explicitly call out this potential issue in `<amp-img>` documentation.\n2. AMP runtime should detect child nodes of `<amp-img>` without the `fallback` attribute and:\n   1. Emit a runtime error to the dev console.\n   2. Move all children of `<amp-img>` to be immediate siblings in the DOM instead.\n"},

That the templating system is designed to run arbitrary templating languages (with Mustache being the only one currently implemented)?

We should not make breaking changes to document-level experiments (including the existing set).\r\n- After the origin experiments code is launched, no longer add any document-level experiments (with a comment in [prod-config.json](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/build-system/global-configs/prod-config.json)).\r\n- After all existing document-level experiments are launched we'll remove the code supporting document-level experiments.\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\nThe original proposal was to do one of the following (in order of preference):\r\n\r\n- removing support for document-level experiments in favor of origin trial experiments\r\n- not allowing breaking changes for features with document-level experiments (with the same policy we use for launched policies), and adding this to our [experiment documentation](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/experimental)\r\n- providing very clear documentation that document-level experiments may break a page at any time, and should not be used on non-experimental production traffic\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nAMP currently supports [document-level experiments](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/experimental), i.e. by adding a meta \"amp-experiments-opt-in\" on a page the page author can enable experiments that are whitelisted for document level experiments (specified in [allow-doc-opt-in in prod-config.json](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/build-system/global-configs/prod-config.json)).\r\n\r\nThere are three main types of experiments we support that a developer can opt into:\r\n\r\n- Experiments enabled in the browser (via cookies or AMP.toggleExperiment), which allows developers to test experimental features but not to push these features to production.\r\n- Document-level experiments, which allows developers to use experimental features in a production setting by adding the meta tag to their document (ideally behind the developers own experiment).\r\n- Origin trial experiments, which allows us to whitelist domains who can enable the experiment features in a production setting (ideally behind the publisher's own experiment).\r\n\r\n# Document-level vs. origin trial\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue with document-level experiments is that we have no good way to know everyone who is using the document-level experiment or to notify them of upcoming breaking changes.  This means that a breaking change in the experiment carries the risk that a page in production breaks.  In contrast, with origin trials the whitelisting process allows us to (a) require developers using the experiment to acknowledge the risks involved in using an experimental feature and (b) collect information that we could use to notify developers using the experimental feature in the case a breaking change will be made.\r\n\r\nThe main use case we've had for document-level experiments thus far has been cases where a few developers are working closely with the AMP community to refine an upcoming feature.  This case is served well by the origin-trial case, and the number of these cases is not very large.\r\n\r\n# Other use cases for document-level experiments\r\n\r\nThe document-level experiment I2I (#6869) has an additional use case for the amp-inabox.  I don't have complete context for that use case so I'd like some input from @lannka whether origin trials is sufficient for that case.  If not we may still be able to move to the \"document-level experiments don't allow breaking changes\" policy.\r\n\r\n/cc @aghassemi @cathyxz @choumx @cramforce @jridgewell @kristoferbaxter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},

However, there are a few issues with this:\r\n\r\n- That page has low discoverability. If we used a YAML file as a source of truth, we could also include actions and events on each component page easily.\r\n- That page is also manually maintained and is centralized. Having the YAML file in each component's directory helps mitigate that, similar to how we have validator specs separated.\r\n- Having an easy-to-process actions and events index would allow us to build better tooling and more documentation automation, which is cool.\r\n- AMP for Email only allows a limited subset of actions and we decided in the last WG meeting to standardize it in some form. Having YAML files makes this easier, as we could just have a `formats` field for each action, similar to how the validator has different rules for different formats.\r\n\r\n## Corner cases\r\n\r\n- Global actions (part of `AMP`) are provided by the runtime. This means no component would have them. Instead, this requires another YAML file for the runtime.\r\n- In additon, there are actions that are not added to any component, but are global: `AMP` and `amp-access`. To handle these, there should be a syntax that indicates the action is on a global object:\r\n```yaml\r\nglobal:\r\n  AMP:\r\n    actions:\r\n      ...\r\n  amp-carousel:\r\n    actions:\r\n      ...\r\n```\r\n- There are events and actions that apply to all elements. We need a special syntax for this too:\r\n```yaml\r\n\"*\":\r\n  events:\r\n    tap:\r\n      ...\r\n```\r\n- Some elements that aren't component (e.g. `input`) may have events. In this case, they could either be part of the component YAML for the most relevant component (`amp-form`) or part of the runtime YAML.\r\n\r\n## Initial creation\r\n\r\nTo initially create these YAML files, we could just parse [amp-actions-and-events.md](https://github.com/ampproject/amp.dev/blob/future/pages/content/amp-dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-actions-and-events.md).\r\n\r\n## Keeping it updated\r\n\r\nIdeas welcome. I wonder if there's a way to make a unit test that ensures a YAML line is in line with what the component provides?\r\n\r\n//cc @sebastianbenz "},
{"text": "## What's the issue?\r\n\r\nNormally when wanting to install a service worker, the way to do so is to use the aptly-named [`amp-install-serviceworker`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-install-serviceworker) component.\r\n\r\nHowever, if wanting to then add push notifications, the [`amp-web-push`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-web-push/) component needs to be used. \r\n\r\nThis introduces a problem because the `amp-web-push` component _also_ takes the responsibility of installing a service worker (apparently). Because only one service worker can be active on a given page, this introduces a conflict.\r\n\r\nThis being said, in testing if I add both components to the page, it doesn't seem to result in the service worker attempting to be installed twice. In fact, only the service worker referenced in `amp-install-serviceworker` is being added, even when I put `<amp-web-push>` _before_ `<amp-install-serviceworker>`. I'm not seeing `<amp-web-push>` install any service worker at all, so maybe I am not correctly understanding how it is supposed to work. However, if it is supposed to install a service worker it could create major confusions when a user tries to supply a service worker script that is specific to push notifications on `<amp-web-push>` but another script entirely for `<amp-install-serviceworker>`. This should get raised by the component as a user error.\r\n\r\nAlso, ideally the `amp-web-push` component would allow omission of the `service-worker-url` attribute if there is an `<amp-install-serviceworker>` element on the page. This would also allow `amp-web-push` to take advantage of the capabilities of `amp-install-serviceworker`, such as installing the origin service worker while accessing a page loaded from an AMP Cache.\r\n\r\nAll of this to say, I am not clear if there is actually a conflict. But since the documentation for the components does not refer to each other, it is not clear if they can work together. If not, they should. And the docs should be updated to clarify.\r\n\r\n## How do we reproduce the issue?\r\n\r\nInclude both `amp-service-worker` and `amp-web-push` on a page."},

This means that if our transaction performed a read before a record is created by another transaction, we won't \"see\" it. In respect to uniqueness constraints, if we try inserting a record that violates it, the database would still protect us, but if we try querying for the record, it'll seem like it doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nIn the context of [`ActiveRecord::Base.create_or_find_by/!`](https://apidock.com/rails/v6.0.0/ActiveRecord/Relation/create_or_find_by), this would manifest as a uniqueness error being raised, but the record not existing.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef create_or_find_by(attributes, &block)\r\n  transaction(requires_new: true) { create(attributes, &block) }\r\nrescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique \r\n  # exception caught, but we can't see the record because it's not present in our snapshot \r\n  find_by!(attributes)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nI created a few [test cases](https://gist.github.com/mzruya/603f722ede1615fd7957cfd95a4d466c#file-test_create_or_find_by_race_condition-rb-L101-L127) that demonstrate the issue.\r\n\r\n### Suggestions\r\nIt doesn't seem like it's possible to fix this behavior, the database isolation level would always prevent us from returning something that another connection committed. \r\n\r\nI do think that there's a misconception (at least I had it) that `ActiveRecord::Base.create_or_find_by` is meant to be atomic and work correctly in concurrent situations. \r\n\r\nTherefore it probably makes sense to document this behavior a bit more thoroughly and mention these caveats in the [docs](https://apidock.com/rails/v6.0.0/ActiveRecord/Relation/create_or_find_by).\r\n\r\nI'll gladly take on improving the current documentation if that seems reasonable.\r\nBut I'd also love to hear if anyone has any other thoughts on this behavior.\r\n\r\nThank you!"},{"labels":[null,"documentation"],"text":"### Steps to reproduce\r\nexecutable test case:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/patrickneugebauer/6cd48c71835cf03aa2a332871f26efdf\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n`validates_presence_of :record` will not allow save if `record` is not persisted and cannot be persisted.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n`validates_presence_of :record` allows save if `record` is not persisted and cannot be persisted.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: Rails 6.0.3.1\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: ruby 2.7.1p83 (2020-03-31 revision a0c7c23c9c) [x86_64-linux]\r\n\r\n### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?\r\nNo, wondering if this is expected before I dig in further.\r\nShould people just know to use `validated_presence_of :record, :record_id` together to ensure integrity of connections?\r\n\r\nI checked the documentation and it is not technically wrong, but I feel it could be improved by adding detail about what is expected.\r\n\r\nhttps://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#presence\r\n\r\n> If you want to be sure that an association is present, you'll need to test whether the associated object itself is present, and not the foreign key used to map the association.

I was surprised that I wouldn't need a another readonly DB user. Not quite sure if this would really work, I did some digging and found that, at least in Postgresql, this method is not sufficient to block all writes. \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nAll of the following queries do write to a Postgresql database in a `while_preventing_writes` block:\r\n\r\n#### Explain analyze\r\n\r\nPostgresql let's you not only explain a query, you can also [explain and analyze](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html) a query which actually **runs** it and also analyzes it:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nActiveRecord::Base.connection_handler.while_preventing_writes do\r\n  ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute \"EXPLAIN ANALYZE INSERT INTO roles_users (role_id, user_id) VALUES (1, 1234)\"\r\n  ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute \"EXPLAIN ANALYZE UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE id = 10\"\r\n  ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute \"EXPLAIN ANALYZE DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 26\"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Nested comments\r\n\r\nPostgres has a [peculiar comment syntax](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-COMMENTS) which lets you nest comments within other comments:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/* comment with nesting: /* nested comment */ */\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is why these comments look like SELECT queries to the regular expression [READ_QUERY](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7cd59448ba7b841b47cf8fdbdab55053e56ba787/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql/database_statements.rb#L23) which is supposed to guard against writes, but to the SQL parser they are comments:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nActiveRecord::Base.connection_handler.while_preventing_writes do\r\n  ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute \"/*/**/SELECT*/ INSERT INTO roles_users (role_id, user_id) VALUES (1, 1234)\"\r\n  ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute \"/*/**/SELECT*/ UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE id = 10\"\r\n  ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute \"/*/**/SELECT*/ DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 26\"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Select into\r\n\r\nFinally postgres let's you create tables using the [`SELECT INTO` statement](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-selectinto.html), which starts the query with a `SELECT` but then goes on to write the result into a new table. While it cannot write into an existing table, technically it's still a write query:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nActiveRecord::Base.connection_handler.while_preventing_writes do\r\n  ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute \"SELECT * INTO users_new FROM users\"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe writing queries are not applied to the database.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe queries are written to the database.  The [regular](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7cd59448ba7b841b47cf8fdbdab55053e56ba787/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql/database_statements.rb#L23) [expression](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7cd59448ba7b841b47cf8fdbdab55053e56ba787/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract_adapter.rb#L69) which is supposed to guard against write queries does not catch the write statements.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nI suspect that parsing SQL with regexes is like parsing HTML with regexes: it cannot work. I suspect that @eileencodes was aware of the limitations of this regular expression approach and mentioned them in the Changelog at the time.\r\n\r\nI did spend a fair amount of time trying to fix these issues and I believe that a somewhat more complex Regex will be able to catch some of these issues, but not all.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the nested comments can have any level of depth, I don't think that they can be solved with Regexes. You will need to parse the SQL and strip out the comments entirely to safeguard against those.\r\n\r\nThe `SELECT INTO` issue is complex as well, as there can be a lot of statements between the `SELECT` and the `INTO` some of which may be strings or comments, so the regular expression approach is probably not going to work here as well. \r\n\r\nI have tests and a fix for the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` queries, if you want me to I can open a pull request for those. I will add a pull request for the documentation change.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\n* Rails master\r\n* ruby 2.7.0p0\r\n* vagrant@rails-dev-box\r\n"},{"labels":[null,"documentation"],"text":"### Steps to reproduce\r\nSearch through the testing portion of the guide [https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html) for an example on how to test a post with a json body.\r\n\r\nThe result will be that you won't find an example that makes it clear on how to do this.

I would like to propose that instead all functions which need a random source accept a local, non-global, `random_seed`/`random_state` argument to which one can pass a random state object, or numpy generator, or something else, which binds random source locally.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nReproducibility if often needed in ML programs. But current approach of setting global random seed in various places in pytorch is suitable only for small programs which are using only pytorch. Now imagine that you have many libraries around, each trying to set global random seed at various times. This can lead to strange changes in random seeds just because you swapped two calls around. Moreover, if any of those libraries stand-alone produces a sequence of numbers, it might be that when used in combination with pytorch the sequence is not anymore the same. So if you are trying to compare two different implementations (one in pytorch one in some other library), the behavior of the implementation in the other library can change just because you also have pytorch around.\r\n\r\nOf course, the other library should also not be using global random source. But ideally pytorch should not either.\r\n\r\nIn our concrete case, we have an AutoML system generating many candidate pipelines using primitives to build those pipelines which in turn use many different libraries. Those pipelines are run and we hope to have full reproducibility (which helps with metalearning). But setting/resetting global random seed just because one primitive in one candidate pipeline we are exploring happens to use pytorch influences behavior of unrelated pipelines.\r\n\r\n## Pitch\r\n\r\nInstead of relying on global random sources, add `random_state` parameter to all functions which expect/use randomness. Do not ever set random seed of a global random source in pytorch code (the user of pytorch can do that themselves if they really want).\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n\r\nUse context managers to set and reset random seeds, but this becomes tricky when using multi-threading.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nSee example in [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-random-state).\n\ncc @jlin27 @pbelevich"},{"labels":[null,"documentation",null],"text":"The only mention of this in the doc is \r\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/0251ba61089795a7a27c0473e4bb022805432c1f/torch/distributed/distributed_c10d.py#L337-L341\r\nwith no example. \n\ncc @pietern @mrshenli @pritamdamania87 @zhaojuanmao @satgera @rohan-varma @gqchen @aazzolini @xush6528 @osalpekar @jlin27"},{"labels":["documentation",null],"text":"##  Bug\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\r\nCurrently, it is a bit tricky to switch from CPU build to CUDA build.

In `rel` mode,\r\ndynamic_threshold = best * ( 1 + threshold ) in 'max'\r\nmode or best * ( 1 - threshold ) in `min` mode.\r\nIn `abs` mode, dynamic_threshold = best + threshold in\r\n`max` mode or best - threshold in `min` mode. Default: 'rel'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is the corresponding excerpt from the code:\r\n```python\r\ndef is_better(self, a, best):\r\n    if self.mode == 'min' and self.threshold_mode == 'rel':\r\n        rel_epsilon = 1. - self.threshold\r\n        return a < best * rel_epsilon\r\n\r\n    elif self.mode == 'min' and self.threshold_mode == 'abs':\r\n        return a < best - self.threshold\r\n\r\n    elif self.mode == 'max' and self.threshold_mode == 'rel':\r\n        rel_epsilon = self.threshold + 1.\r\n        return a > best * rel_epsilon\r\n\r\n    else:  # mode == 'max' and epsilon_mode == 'abs':\r\n        return a > best + self.threshold\r\n```\r\n\r\nI use `NegativeDiceLoss` in my experiments so the loss is negative and is expected to be minimized. The only correct mode of `ReduceLROnPlateau` I can use is `threshold_mode='abs'` because `threshold_mode='rel'` will not work for minimizing negative loss.\r\n\r\nImagine `mode='min', threshold_mode='rel', threshold=0.1`:\r\n* If we use loss that is expected to be > 0 all the time and current loss value is `10` than dynamic threshold will be `(1 - 0.1) * 10 == 9`. And the check will be `a < 9`. So there will be a margin between previous loss value and the new one to ensure that model improved.\r\n* If we use loss that is expected to be < 0 all the time (as in my case with `NegativeDiceLoss`) and current loss value is `-10` than dynamic threshold will be `(1 - 0.1) * -10 == -9`. And the check will be `a < -9`. __It does not correspond to logic of scheduler__ as it allows new loss value to be slightly worse than previous. As I understand the goal of the dynamic threshold is to guarantee that the loss improved __by some margin__ to deal with noise in loss calculations.\r\n\r\nIf my understanding is correct it is better to __explicitly state in documentation__ that for `threshold_mode='rel'` only positive loss functions are expexted. Probably negative loss functions are not common to use but sometimes they are required (as with dice score as loss function).\r\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong :)"},{"labels":["documentation",null,null],"text":"## 📚 Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what content in https://pytorch.org/docs is an issue.

However, FakeQuantize does not use STE.

We've since added other APIs, and the original was never given a distinctive name.\r\n\r\nBesides consistency, here are some reasons for the change:\r\n\r\n1) \"Remote\" is redundant – all HTTP APIs are remote. \"Docker API\" would collide with other Docker APIs, hence \"Docker Engine API\".\r\n2) When you want to find the API for the Engine, it's not immediately clear that you should be looking for the \"Remote API\". (And vice versa, \"Remote API\" does not make it immediately obvious that it's the thing the Engine exposes.)\r\n3) The information architecture in the documentation is a bit weird, because \"Remote API\" doesn't comfortably sit under \"Engine\".\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nThe only place we reference it seems to be in the documentation and CLI docs, so looks like we can just do a big ol' search and replace.\r\n\r\nThe only breakage I can think of is if people search for \"Docker Remote API\" on Google and the documentation doesn't turn up. To counteract this, we can leave it as the \"Remote API\" in old versions of the API documentation, and add \"Remote API\" to the keywords of the latest API docs.

The error claiming that an image is missing is often not complete displayed either when using `docker service ps` since the message is too long, which requires the user to login into the machine where the docker daemon is running and checking the logs there... not very friendly.\nI have not found in the documentation that an image that is custom built must be pushed to a image registry in order to make the swarm work, which for me at least, took some precious time to discover the hard way. \nSo finally, I think the best solution would be if every swarm node could act as a private image registry out of the box, but only for the nodes part of that swarm. By doing that images will just be created once and everything will work magically as so many other things in docker. The other alternative I can think of is that when building an image you could pass a --swarm flag to tell docker that you want to build that same image on all the nodes part of the swarm.

Therefore, node labels could be useful to e.g. schedule only on machines where certain special workloads should be run, for instance machines where [PCI-SS compliance](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) is met.  A compromised worker could not compromise these special workloads because it cannot change node labels.\n3. Engine labels, however, are still useful because some features which do not affect secure orchestration of containers might be better off set in a decentralized manner.

This issues is there to discuss on those subjects and follow evolutions of our generation process.\n\nThe main goals are the following and take most of the inspiration from `git` man pages and reference documentation :\n- Have consistent man page across commands.\n- Have cli reference documentation be in sync (or the same) as man page (just a web page for it).\n- Have (or not) man pages generated from source (part of it or all of them).\n### Man page style guide\n\nWe currently don't have any style guide for man pages, i.e. what information to put where and in what order. As code style guide, we might want to define a _man page style guide_ document that would define what makes a good man page for `docker` commands. This is related to #16219.\n\nThat could look something like :\n\n```\n## NAME\n\ncommand - short description of the command\n\n## SYNOPSIS\n\ncommand --with --some --flags --and [OPTIONS] …\n\n##  DESCRIPTION\n\nA description is more detailed than what's in the NAME section, explaining more in depth what the command does (but that's all)\n\n## OPTIONS\n\n-a --all\n\nFlags descriptions …\n\n## ADDITIONAL SECTION 1\n\nAdditional section are possible. An example would be `FILTERING` and `FORMATTING` for the `docker-ps` command, or something about the reference format for command that allow us to set them (like `docker-commit`, `docker-tag`, …).\n\n## ADDITIONAL SECTION 2\n\nNo limit in the number of section though 👼\n\n## EXAMPLES\n\nHere, we just gives example on how to do this on that ; this is not where we explain how to filter container (it's done in its own section), just a working example of it.\n\n## ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES\n\nIf there is any environment variable or configuration (in the client/daemon config file) related to the command, we'll talk about it here ; like `ImagesFormat` for `docker-images` formatting.\n\n## SEE ALSO\n\n```\n### Man page and cli ref doc maintainability\n\nMaintaining separately man pages and cli reference documentation is error prone, it's easy to forget some flags or description somewhere. It's related to #19088. The basic idea would be to generate man pages and cli reference documentation from the same source.\n\nGiven that we are trying to generate man page from the code (at least partially), we should also study a way to generate cli reference documentation at the same time — shouldn't be difficult to convert markdown/man page to hmtl 👼.\n#23825 introduced a way to generate man page directly from code — from a small subset of command right now, but goal is to do that for all commands.\n\nCurrent limitations / questions are the following (making the assumption that cli reference documentation is generated from the same source) :\n- Cobra does not seems to allow add any custom section (it only supports `EXAMPLE`).  It's possible to add `## Some Section` in the description part, but this would make the `OPTIONS` section be really far down in the man pages (which can be fine :angel:).\n- It makes \"documentation\" PR's becomes more difficult; to make changes to this part of the documentation now requires contributors to touch the actual code.\n- Should we keep around some part of the man pages/documentation in markdown files (that would be merge with generated content from cobra) ?\n\n/cc @thaJeztah @dnephin @icecrime \n"},{"labels":["documentation"],"text":"Is it intentional to have 1.12 `/swarm/leave` to have a query param of `?force=true`?

The link to the [Image[@digest]](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#image-digest) section anchor doesn't have an example, which I think might have been useful. I believe therefore it might be beneficial to update the documentation regarding using digests.\n\nI suggest the **General Form** section to be:\n\n```\n$ docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE[:TAG|@sha256:DIGEST] [COMMAND] [ARG...]\n```\n\nIf there are other possible digests, then sha256 could be changed to DIGEST_TYPE or something similar.\n\nSecondly I suggest that the [Image[@digest]](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#image-digest) anchor have the following example of using the digest:\n\n```\ndocker run alpine@sha256:9cacb71397b640eca97488cf08582ae4e4068513101088e9f96c9814bfda95e0 date\n```\n\nThis is my feedback from initially trying to get digests to run with `docker run`. If this was confusing to me, it might possibly be confusing to other users.\n"},{"labels":["documentation"],"text":"The the Docker Remote API v1.24 (https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/docs/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.24.md), the REST function,\n\nTag an image into a repository\n\ndoes not really explain what the function does.\n"},{"labels":["documentation"],"text":"Tutorial  [Work with a development container](https://docs.docker.com/opensource/project/set-up-dev-env/) talks about the **binary** directory.
