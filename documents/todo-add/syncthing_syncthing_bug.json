Create empty folders A, B\r\n2. Add to syncthing folder A, specifying staggered versioning and versioning destination folder B\r\n3. If you click on the newly created folder Versions button, it correctly says \"No data\".\r\n4. Create folder B/no_access, and, within this folder, create file B/no_access/do_not_delete\r\n5. Set read-only and no execution o on both file and folder chmod -R 444 B/no_access\r\n6. Versioner spits the error: \r\n``` \r\n2020-07-08 11:23:07: Versioner: error scanning versions dir lstat .../B/no_access/do_not_delete: permission denied \r\n```\r\n7. Clicking on Versions button now prints \"Loading data...\" and nothing more.\r\n8. If you change the B/no_access permissions to 555, everything works as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to solve itself by simply giving 555 to the no_access folder. I see not technical reason to require all subfolders of a versioning destination to be accessible to the syncthing process.\r\n\r\n# Why do I expect this to work? \r\n\r\nSyncthing does versioning only for changes it receives from remote parties, but it has no way to properly do versioning on local files. if you activate versioning on one of the remote devices, versions will be safe on that remote storage. But to restore a version stored remotely, you should have some other means of connecting to the remote machine. The local syncthing instance does not allow any way of browsing and retrieving versions which are stored remotely.\r\n\r\nSo I came to the following solution, which allows to locally share versions which are produced remotely:\r\n\r\n1. Local shares local/A with remote, SendOnly\r\n2. Remote receives A in remote/A, ReceiveOnly, and stores versions in remote/B\r\n3. Remote shares remote/B with local, SendOnly\r\n4. Local receives remote/B in local/B, ReceiveOnly\r\n5. Local specifies that the versions folder for local/A is local/B\r\n\r\nThis way, local can directly access to remote versions through the same syncthing interface, because they are shared back in local/B. In case of extreme damage, like crypto attack, you can always rever all local versions\r\n\r\nThe problem is the .stfolder marker. remote/B and local/B have dual meaning: they both are used as versioning destinations AND they are shared back with the other device. \r\n\r\nSo they must have an .stfolder: something the Versioner does not expect. Infact, it will soon delete the .stfolder marker and this will in turn stop the sharing.\r\n\r\nSo I came to this solution: I protect the .stfolder by creating a read-only file inside of it, and making read-only also the folder. As this bug report discovered, the folder must be accessible (x). I hope alien folders/files will not stop the Versioner in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"### Does your log mention database corruption?\r\n\r\nIf your Syncthing log reports panics because of database corruption it is\r\nmost likely a fault with your system's storage or memory.

Many of those look unresolved to me, frozen due to age, etc. but perhaps this has been fixed in the meantime, and/or someone more familiar with the codebase could refer me somewhere more relevant.\r\n\r\nIf above is not the case, I suppose you will want full logs for further troubleshooting, so let me work on sanitizing PII out of those and then I will try to find some place to upload them and share a link here.  There are also perhaps relevant clues in that other thread, but I won't repeat those here (for now)."},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"### Does your log mention database corruption?\r\n\r\nnot applicable\r\n\r\n### Include required information\r\n\r\nWhen trying to set up a new relay server on server with IPv6-only connection, it could not join the relays pool server.

There is one digit missing in the number of seconds specifying the 30-days-interval.\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterval: [4]interval{\r\n    {30, 3600},       // first hour -> 30 sec between versions\r\n    {3600, 86400},    // next day -> 1 h between versions\r\n    {86400, 592000},  // next 30 days -> 1 day between versions  // This line is causing the issue\r\n    {604800, maxAge}, // next year -> 1 week between versions\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe number saying `592000` actually is a time period of 6.8 days only instead of the intended 30 days. The correct number would be `2592000` (Note the leading 2 which is missing).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the tests implemented in `lib/versioner/staggered_test.go` do not cover the issue above.\r\n\r\nI have fixed the interval number and updated the tests and could provide a patch for that."},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"The \"number of items to display\" option at the foot of the pop-up page is (thankfully!) persistent, but so is the page number.  When the pop-up page is closed _(either with the \"Close\" button or by clicking on originating page \"behind\" the pop-up page)_, the page number that was being displayed is also persistent, so that on re-opening the pop-up _(which always displays page 1 of the refreshed list)_, the page number displayed is wrong - should be 1, of course.\r\n\r\n**A very, VERY minor bug in a superb package!**\r\n\r\nMay I be a nuisance and - as it's related to the same part of SyncThing - mention a preference?

Device B shows (in syncthing UI) that it's \"Up to Date\" with device A.\r\n2. Device B shows local state different from global state for the folder X. Both device A and device B show the same global state (which is expected).\r\n3. Device A shows \"syncing\" with device B, but nothing really happens.\r\n4. Device A shows some \"Out of Sync Items\" - I randomly checked 4-5 files on device B - they exist there.

In syncthing UI device A and device B show different number of files for this folder (and different total size) - that's unexpected, and each of them shows that local state is equal to global state.

I personally have encountered this error when trying to share a folder from Android, and then realising that I would rather share a folder from a different device which would point at the same path. Thus, I accepted the newly shared folder, and then removed the one created previously in Android, as it was no longer needed. The result of the operation was as above.\r\n\r\nThis was just a simple mistake of mine, but I can also easily imagine valid reasons for sharing the same folder multiple times, such as having different ignore patterns for each of them, etc. In addition to that, to actually fix the problem, one needs to manually recreate the missing `.stfolder` which, depending on the operating system, may not be straightforward.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v1.3.0\r\n"},{"labels":["bug"],"text":"### Does your log mention database corruption?\r\n\r\nLog grows to 69 GB I can not open the file to read it.

If SyncTrayzor is open, it will actually use 100% of CPU and make everything unresponsive due to the console log display in SyncTrayzor itself. Without SyncTrayzor, it is just Syncthing.exe using ~50% of CPU in a mid-range 4 core system. Fortunately, the system is still responsive enough to operate, but this may not be the case on a slower device. Also, the folder status in the Web GUI keeps changing rapidly with no end to it. The only way to fix the issue seems to be to manually edit the `.stignore` file and fix the incorrect path there which as a result stops the log spam. Unfortunately, the Web GUI does not allow to edit the incorrect path directly, as the \"Ignored Patterns\" window is grayed out with a `Failed to load ignored patterns.` message.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to simply log the problem once so that the user knows of the incorrect path, and not spam the log with the error messages? Right now, even a simple spellling mistake in the #include path can cause this issue.

This prevents falling back to dialing of other addresses. \r\n\r\nTwo possible solutions come to mind:\r\n- Dialer should check node ID after establishing connection before returning success. \r\n- If a successful connection exists via an address and a different device announces the very same address (including the dialing device's addresses themselves), dialing that and assuming to reach the other device is not logical. This could be suppressed. \r\n\r\nTwo examples in which this causes issues:\r\n1. Two hosts behind the same NAT, one directly reachable via port forwarding, both configured to the same (default) listening port. An outside node successfully connects to the port-forwarded node, then tries to connect to the NATed node using the same external IP and port, and establishes a successful connection - but to the wrong node. \r\n2. Syncthing running on a NATting device itself with other nodes behind the NAT. In this case, the NATting device may be tricked into trying to connect to itself. \r\n\r\nExample logs (anonymized) follow. \r\nCase 1:\r\n```\r\n2019/08/06 19:25:34.081495 structs.go:217: DEBUG: dialing UUID_OF_DEVICE_WE_WANT_TO_REACH tcp://EXTERNAL_IP_OF_NAT:22000 prio 10\r\n2019/08/06 19:25:34.117970 tcp_dial.go:48: DEBUG: Dial (BEP/tcp): setting traffic class: setsockopt: protocol not available\r\n2019/08/06 19:25:34.546076 structs.go:222: DEBUG: dialing UUID_OF_DEVICE_WE_WANT_TO_REACH tcp://EXTERNAL_IP_OF_NAT:22000 success: LOCAL_IP_OF_DIALING_NODE:49308-EXTERNAL_IP_OF_NAT:22000/tcp-client/TLS1.3-TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256\r\n2019/08/06 19:25:34.546099 service.go:872: DEBUG: connected to UUID_OF_DEVICE_WE_WANT_TO_REACH 10 using LOCAL_IP_OF_DIALING_NODE:49308-EXTERNAL_IP_OF_NAT:22000/tcp-client/TLS1.3-TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 10\r\n...\r\n2019/08/06 19:25:34.546161 service.go:875: DEBUG: discarding 0 connections while connecting to UUID_OF_DEVICE_WE_WANT_TO_REACH 10\r\n...\r\n2019/08/06 19:25:34.546258 service.go:477: DEBUG: sleep until next dial 1m0s\r\n2019/08/06 19:25:34.723211 service.go:282: INFO: Connected to already connected device UUID_OF_OTHER_DEVICE_BEHIND_THE_SAME_NAT (existing: LOCAL_IP_OF_DIALING_NODE:48686-EXTERNAL_IP_OF_NAT:22000/tcp-client/TLS1.3-TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 new: LOCAL_IP_OF_DIALING_NODE:49308-EXTERNAL_IP_OF_NAT:22000/tcp-client/TLS1.3-TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCase 2:\r\n```\r\n2019/08/06 19:21:34.136916 structs.go:217: DEBUG: dialing UUID_OF_DEVICE_WE_WANT_TO_REACH tcp://EXTERNAL_IP_OF_NATTING_DEVICE:22000 prio 9\r\n2019/08/06 19:21:34.137011 tcp_listen.go:107: DEBUG: Listen (BEP/tcp): connect from EXTERNAL_IP_OF_NATTING_DEVICE:39702\r\n2019/08/06 19:21:34.186905 structs.go:222: DEBUG: dialing UUID_OF_DEVICE_WE_WANT_TO_REACH tcp://EXTERNAL_IP_OF_NATTING_DEVICE:22000 success: EXTERNAL_IP_OF_NATTING_DEVICE:39702-EXTERNAL_IP_OF_NATTING_DEVICE:22000/tcp-client/TLS1.3-TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\n2019/08/06 19:21:34.186926 service.go:872: DEBUG: connected to UUID_OF_DEVICE_WE_WANT_TO_REACH 9 using EXTERNAL_IP_OF_NATTING_DEVICE:39702-EXTERNAL_IP_OF_NATTING_DEVICE:22000/tcp-client/TLS1.3-TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 10\r\n2019/08/06 19:21:34.187022 service.go:229: INFO: Connected to myself (UUID_OF_NATTING_DEVICE) at EXTERNAL_IP_OF_NATTING_DEVICE:39702-EXTERNAL_IP_OF_NATTING_DEVICE:22000/tcp-client/TLS1.3-TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 -

For instance:\r\n- `sysctl.conf` has `fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 204800`\r\n- directory (root folder) has `379320` directories (but only `103917` directories not ignored) and `1970011` files (but only `41029` files not ignored)\r\n\r\nIncreasing the inotify limit to 1M+ fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n## Questions/thoughts/ideas\r\n\r\n- does the inotify limit need to be higher than all directories (ignored + not ignored)?\r\n- is there a way to list all files/directories to be watched? This way, we could prevent this issue by determining a correct value before increasing it with random values (here `204800` as stated in the docs doesn't help). Or perhaps just give the information in the error: `inotify limit was hit, XXX directories are to be watched (see ...)`.\r\n- using `strace`, I've seen a lot of calls to `inotify_rm_watch`. I don't understand why? Is it because I've reached the inotify limit? After increasing the limit, there's no more calls.\r\n- hitting the inotify limit should be reported as `INFO` or `WARNING` in the logs. I've searched a lot before understanding why my files were not in sync, enabling verbose helped a lot, because the message was clear: inotify issue (+ link to how to deal with the issue).\r\n- I've used `sysctl -p` to update the limit right now, after editing `/etc/sysctl.conf`, perhaps it would be useful to update your docs for this very command, I think it's better as it uses the real configuration file (`/etc/sysctl.conf`), so no bad surprises on reboot.\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nThank you for this tool, used alongside of Unison for other purposes, it's really great!\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v1.1.3\r\nOS Version: Debian stable (Stretch), using https://apt.syncthing.net/ repository\r\n\r\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"Sometimes it doesn't work over network filesystems.

(They usually aren't.)\r\n\r\nFirst I set it up on the AWS instance, then I set it up on my Macbook. I set things synchronizing and after a couple of hiccups I had a couple folders duplicated on the dedicated server. (Per hiccups: Syncing slows down massively when the GUI is open?? I mean, I get why this could happen, but some kind of notice in the GUI would have been really helpful, I spent like an hour troubleshooting why network would be having problems that could explain the slow transfer rate when in fact it all had to do with the GUI.)\r\n\r\nThen I set it up on Windows. I have been using Dropbox up to now, and the reason I'm setting up Syncthing is because Dropbox is ending support for my Macbook's OS. This means that all the files I need to sync were already being synchronized by Dropbox. I shared the smaller of the two folders I've been trying out with Syncthing between all the devices and everything was great. Syncthing recognized right away that everything was already synchronized. Then I shared the larger one and things were fine at first, but then my Macbook and the AWS instance both started getting confused.\r\n\r\n# What happened next\r\n\r\nExcept for when I pause the larger folder being shared, both my Macbook and the AWS instance are reporting very high CPU usage. The GUI shows the folder in a \"Failed Files\" state. Syncthing seemed to be repeatedly scanning the folder. I did _not_ have this problem when sharing the folder from my Macbook with the AWS instance, this issue only occurred after adding my Windows machine to the bunch.\r\n\r\n# The log\r\n\r\nHere is a portion of the very noisy log from syncthing on OSX.

It's not a logical deadlock, it's just that sending events can end up taking forever, which blocks other things. We often send events while holding other locks, which makes it worse.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, when an event listener no longer polls for events the Log() call will block for 150 ms per non-polling listener. If there are several dead listeners this can add up, and it blocks other Log() calls during this time as well due to needing to hold the lock. \r\n\r\nThere are a couple of places where we can end up with dead event listeners. The [watch aggregator can exit but never unsubscribes](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/c9349183478321cc434b92cd8d7dc9bfefed82db/lib/watchaggregator/aggregator.go#L135-L162). But more seriously, anything that 1) ceases to process events 2) unsubscribes, perhaps as part of a defer, causes this issue. For example, [sendIndexes](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/c9349183478321cc434b92cd8d7dc9bfefed82db/lib/model/model.go#L1823-L1861).\r\n\r\nThe reason for the latter is that once we stop reading events, the Unsubscribe() can take effectively forever. There might be a thousand event senders producing events quite frequently (for example, lots of folders which are scanning on a short interval). These all compete for the mutex which must be held to unsubscribe. As each of these calls can take over a second and there are thousands and thousands of them waiting for the lock, the odds that our Unsubscribe() call actually gets to acquire the lock in reasonable time are slim.\r\n\r\nI have a test that reproduces this sad situation.\r\n\r\nI see several potential solutions; first of all we must ensure that every subscribe is matched by an unsubscribe. Then;\r\n\r\n1. We can use a [priority lock](https://github.com/platinummonkey/priority-lock) to prioritize Subscribe()/Unsubscribe() over Log(). This works nicely in my testing, because the unsubscribe gets to happen ahead of the queue and then everything else is quick again.\r\n\r\n2. We can use BufferedSubscriptions() everywhere, as these continue reading the actual event stream in the background until the unsubscribe has actually gotten through.\r\n\r\n3. We can make the event system more lossy, putting the burden to keep up with the events more on the receiving side. A normal Subscription already has a buffered channel; we could simply skip the timeout handling in Log() and use a non-blocking send.\r\n\r\nI think we should do number 1 at minimum, and possibly number 3. In the cases where we expect many events and have to catch 'em all, that's what the buffered subscription is for.\r\n\r\nAs a motivator, here's a massive backtrace showing the problem (on 0.14.48).\r\n\r\n[backtrace.txt](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/files/2673301/backtrace.txt)\r\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"Hi,\r\n\r\nI get issue with logging normalizing failures, with empty file field:\r\n\r\nDec 12 08:27:48 XXXXXXXXXXX syncthing[1438]: [E6UP4] INFO: Scanner (folder var-www, file \"\"): normalizing path: item has UTF8 encoding conflict with another item\r\n\r\nWhen ewerything in normalizePath then it returns empty path\r\n~/go/src/github.com/syncthing/syncthing/lib/scanner/walk.go:468\r\nfunc (w *walker) normalizePath(path string, info fs.FileInfo) (normPath string, err error) {\r\n...\r\n           return \"\", errUTF8Conflict\r\n}\r\n\r\nAnd this empty path i logged\r\n~/go/src/github.com/syncthing/syncthing/lib/scanner/walk.go:290\r\nfunc (w *walker) handleItem(ctx context.Context, path string, toHashChan chan<- protocol.FileInfo, finishedChan chan<- ScanResult, skip error) error {\r\n...\r\n           path, err = w.normalizePath(path, info)\r\n           if err != nil {\r\n                      w.handleError(ctx, \"normalizing path\", path, err, finishedChan)\r\n                      return skip\r\n           }\r\n\r\nI dirty fix this by:\r\n\r\n           oldpath := path\r\n           path, err = w.normalizePath(path, info)\r\n           if err != nil {\r\n                      w.handleError(ctx, \"normalizing path\", oldpath, err, finishedChan)\r\n                      return skip\r\n           }\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v0.14.54\r\nOS Version: Debian 9\r\n"},{"labels":["bug"],"text":"### Easy to reproduce\r\n\r\n$ cd $HOME/Sync/data\r\n$ ln -snf /link-a-non-existing-file  to-here\r\n\r\nor from any sub folders inside your sync path\r\n\r\n$ cd $HOME/Sync/data/ebooks\r\n$ ln -snf /usr/local/www/non-existing  book.pdf\r\n\r\nthen you will see the error message from your browser.\r\n\r\n```\r\nFilesystem Watcher Errors: error while traversing /path/to/exists/file_or_dir: no such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nv0.14.54, FreeBSD (64 bit) \r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v0.14.54\r\nOS Version: FreeBSD 12.0-RC2\r\nBrowser Version: Chrome Version 70.0.3538.67 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"The WebUI updates based on changes made to settings by the user before those changes have been processed by the server.

I have two examples below. They are similar in the sense that the Folder path and folder marker are gone when the issue happens.\r\n\r\n## Example 1\r\n### What happened\r\n- I had a Folder added to Syncthing residing at path `/Volumes/foo/bar/baz` which is on an external hard drive. Just to clarify, the folder marker is `/Volumes/foo/bar/baz/.stfolder`.\r\n- I decided to move it to somewhere else but also decided to deal with updating the path of the Folder later.\r\n- I paused the Folder in Syncthing UI.\r\n- I moved the folder to its new location. `foo` directory doesn't exist in `/Volumes` anymore.\r\n- [issue] When I restart Syncthing it creates the `/Volumes/foo/bar/baz` directory structure while the Folder is still paused.\r\n- [expected] If I resume the Folder I get `folder marker missing` error\r\n\r\n### What I expected to happen\r\n- Syncthing should not create `foo/bar/baz` directories in `/Volumes`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n- Create a few directories inside each other on an external drive (I am not sure if the drive being external is necessary, that is just how my setup is)\r\n- Add the deepest directory to Syncthing as a Folder\r\n- Pause the Folder\r\n- Delete the whole directory structure up to the root of the external drive\r\n- Restart Syncthing\r\n- Observe.

Just to clarify, the folder marker is `/Volumes/EncFS/.stfolder`.\r\n- When I restart my computer, that encrypted directory is not mounted automatically.\r\n- [issue] Syncthing start automatically and gives me `Creating directory for foobar: mkdir /Volumes/EncFS: permission denied ` error.

Please let me know if my report is in some way incomplete or otherwise deficient; I will happily attempt to correct.\r\n\r\nTo set the stage:  A x86-64 Windows syncthing is attempting to push some magic symlinks to my arm-based backup box (\"J5AZA-...\").  Tragically, something is going very wrong and it's caught in a loop and not able to make progress, specifically around these symlinks; everything else made it over just fine.  The Windows machine is attempting to synchronize almost the entirety of a user's home directory (barring /AppData and /Sync, which are excluded by ignore patterns).  The arm machine's storage is backed by ext4 and manually creating symlinks, files, and directories is all fine.\r\n\r\nstracing the syncthing on my arm box (and filtering manually down to what appears to be relevant), one sees a great deal of file system activity, but none of it actually appears to be, well, symlink in nature.  Behold.\r\n\r\nWe begin by creating a temporary file with what looks like a reasonable collection of flags to me (though oddly, not a symlink)...\r\n```\r\n[pid  7469] openat(AT_FDCWD,

write the symlink target into it, check the clock twice, and then close the file:\r\n```\r\n[pid 10634] pwrite64(63, \"/Users/Thomas/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCookies\\0\\0\", 59, 0) =

Version**: Firefox 49.0.2_\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\n **- what happened:**\r\nSyncThing monitored over web interface and it showed 3/3 listeners(two relays and local IP).\r\nI stopped one of relay server, then upgraded it to the latest version and restarted. \r\nUpgraded relay itself is working fine.\r\nSyncThing showed 2/3 listeners regardless how long one ready to wait.\r\nWhen relay was upgraded and restarted syncthing stuck on 2/3 listeners and upgraded relay does not show any connection from clients too (\"numConnections\": 0,)\r\nAfter syncthing forcibly was restarted via web gui menu, syncthing found all relays again\r\n\r\n **- what you expected to happen instead:**\r\nI assume that syncthing should query relay on reguar basis and reconnect to it automatically in case of network issue with relay or relay simply restarted.\r\n\r\n **- any steps to reproduce the problem:**\r\nPrecondition: running own latest relay (strelaysrv-~10+12) and discovery(stdiscosrv-linux-arm-v0.14.10+6) servers. Query to discovery and relays issued with certificate pinning (providing UUID of remote relay in URL). Relays and discovery server listening on non default ports.\r\n\r\nEverything works fine until one of relays stopped for a period of time longer than \r\nspecified in query url to relay (...pingInterval=1m0s&networkTimeout=2m0s...)\r\nAfter that, syncthing will not automatically reconnect to relay that was restarted. \r\nThe only restart of synthing can fix issue.\r\n\r\nFirst, I think it somehow related to a new version of stRelay but it isn't (tried to run previous version with the same effect - if relay stopped for long period of time and started again, clients cant see restarted relay anymore until clients itself restarted)"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"For some unknown reason, I entered `syncthing /paths` instead of `syncthing -paths` at the command line for a user not currently running syncthing.\n\nIt seems that st ignores any arguments other than options, and started normally, creating files and certificates and launching the gui.\n\nOptions appear to be validated as expected. `syncthing -paths` and `syncthing --paths` are accepted and show the expected information.  `syncthing ---paths` and `syncthing -junk` respond as `syncthing -help`.\n\nHowever, there seems to be no validation that the rest of the command line is empty apart from comments.\n\nNo great harm happened - just a few files to delete.\n\nI consider this a minor, embarrassing bug.\n### Version Information\n\nSyncthing Version: v0.14.9\nOS Version: Debian stretch...\nBrowser Version: n/a\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"OK, this is a hard one :-).\n\nI have a synced folder; lets call it `watch_folder`.  I create backups of my `watch_folder` within another synced folder (let's call it `backup_folder`).  If I delete old backups of the `watch_folder` within my `backup_folder`.  Then, I get the following error on another device (not the one where I delete the folders).\n\n```\nOct 12 15:26:17 hostname syncthing[3506]: [ABCDE] INFO: Puller (folder \"backup_folder\", dir \"path/to/watch_folder\"): delete: remove /path/to/watch_folder: directory not empty\n```\n\nIf I look at that folder, I find a `.stfolder` file.\n### Version Information\n\nsyncthing v0.14.8 \"Dysprosium Dragonfly\" (go1.7.1 linux-amd64) builduser@svetlemodry 2016-10-04 16:51:21 UTC\nLinux schwarzbaer 4.7.6-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Sep 30 19:28:42 CEST 2016 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"The GUI shows me two Out of Sync items, but the \"Failed Items\" list is loading, and never loads.\n\n![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/568104/19054170/03431f9a-89b6-11e6-973b-bfa6ad2c7104.png)\n\nLooking at the source, it looks like this should be populated by the FolderErrors event, but requesting `/rest/events` gives me no FolderErrors events. I can see StateChanged events for it, where it starts scanning, then stops again, but that's it. Grabbing the scope for that folder, and looking at `failed` also returns an empty object.\n\nThe computer which the files were being synced from is currently offline, and Syncthing was restarted since (in order to upgrade from 0.14.5). Could this be related - Syncthing isn't trying to fetch the file, and so can't remember why it failed?\n\nIf so, showing 'Out of Sync' and the 'loading' icon is somewhat misleading - it implies that more information is going to appear soon. Would it make sense to record the reason for failure in the database? At the very least, better indicate that no devices are online, and so details about the files items aren't going to be available for a while.\n### Version Information\n\nSyncthing Version: v0.14.7\nOS Version: Linux StorageDroid 3.10.103-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Aug 29 20:27:51 MDT 2016 armv7l GNU/Linux\nBrowser Version: FF 49.0.1\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"Syncthing deadlocks seemingly at random.

generate a certificate and stuff. What happens for me is that the browser starts and tries to load localhost:8384, but the server hasn't started yet so the browser gets a connection refused.\n\nReload then works, of course. And on next startup we are fast enough for this not to happen. Probably depends on the browser being able to load quite rapidly when asked to.\n\nWe should delay starting the browser until we know the listener is up and running, by using a channel or some other magic (an event perhaps).\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"v0.14.6 reports this:\n\n```\n23:36:13 INFO: syncthing v0.14.6 \"Dysprosium Dragonfly\" (go1.7 linux-amd64) builduser@svetlemodry

expected this update to start normally like all the other versions\n- any steps to reproduce the problem: I downgraded to 14.6 and everything runs normally. I updated to 14.7 through the GUI and the same issue happens (see log file below). I rebooted and downgraded again to 14.6 and everything runs normally.

Thanks for your help.\n### Version Information\n\n---\n\nSyncthing Version: v0.14.7\nOS Version: \nPRETTY_NAME=\"Debian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie)\"\nNAME=\"Debian GNU/Linux\"\nVERSION_ID=\"8\"\nVERSION=\"8 (jessie)\"\nID=debian\nHOME_URL=\"http://www.debian.org/\"\nSUPPORT_URL=\"http://www.debian.org/support\"\nBUG_REPORT_URL=\"https://bugs.debian.org/\"\n\nBoard: Odroid C2\nProcessor: Arm64 -> Amlogic ARM® Cortex®-A53(ARMv8) 1.5Ghz quad core CPUs\n\nBrowser Version: n/a\n## Log Output\n\n```\nroot@omv-c2: syncthing\n[monitor] 07:13:16 INFO: Starting syncthing\nSIGILL: illegal instruction\nPC=0x368ebc m=0\n\ngoroutine 1 [running, locked to thread]:\ngithub.com/syncthing/syncthing/vendor/github.com/minio/sha256-simd.blockArm(0x442003bbb8, 0x8, 0x8, 0x4420130000, 0x20000, 0x20000, 0xbb67ae856a09e667, 0xa54ff53a3c6ef372, 0x9b05688c510e527f, 0x5be0cd191f83d9ab, ...)\n    /home/buildslave/workspace/syncthing-release/src/github.com/syncthing/syncthing/vendor/github.com/minio/sha256-simd/sha256block_arm64.s:59 +0x5c fp=0x442003bb80 sp=0x442003bb80\ngithub.com/syncthing/syncthing/vendor/github.com/minio/sha256-simd.blockArmGo(0x442003bd50, 0x4420130000, 0x20000, 0x20000)\n    /home/buildslave/workspace/syncthing-release/src/github.com/syncthing/syncthing/vendor/github.com/minio/sha256-simd/sha256block_arm64.go:32 +0xd8 fp=0x442003bc20 sp=0x442003bb80\ngithub.com/syncthing/syncthing/vendor/github.com/minio/sha256-simd.block(0x442003bd50, 0x4420130000, 0x20000, 0x20000)\n    /home/buildslave/workspace/syncthing-release/src/github.com/syncthing/syncthing/vendor/github.com/minio/sha256-simd/sha256.go:79 +0x108 fp=0x442003bc60 sp=0x442003bc20\ngithub.com/syncthing/syncthing/vendor/github.com/minio/sha256-simd.(*digest).Write(0x442003bd50, 0x4420130000, 0x20000, 0x20000, 0x20000, 0x0, 0x0)\n    /home/buildslave/workspace/syncthing-release/src/github.com/syncthing/syncthing/vendor/github.com/minio/sha256-simd/sha256.go:125 +0x1b8 fp=0x442003bcf0 sp=0x442003bc60\ngithub.com/syncthing/syncthing/vendor/github.com/minio/sha256-simd.Sum256(0x4420130000, 0x20000, 0x20000, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)\n    /home/buildslave/workspace/syncthing-release/src/github.com/syncthing/syncthing/vendor/github.com/minio/sha256-simd/sha256.go:100 +0xc4 fp=0x442003bdc0 sp=0x442003bcf0\ngithub.com/syncthing/syncthing/lib/protocol.init()\n    /home/buildslave/workspace/syncthing-release/src/github.com/syncthing/syncthing/lib/protocol/bep_extensions.go:25 +0xadc fp=0x442003be40 sp=0x442003bdc0\ngithub.com/syncthing/syncthing/lib/config.init()\n    /home/buildslave/workspace/syncthing-release/src/github.com/syncthing/syncthing/lib/config/wrapper.go:360 +0x88 fp=0x442003beb0 sp=0x442003be40\nmain.init()\n    /home/buildslave/workspace/syncthing-release/src/github.com/syncthing/syncthing/cmd/syncthing/verboseservice.go:187 +0xb0 fp=0x442003bf40 sp=0x442003beb0\nruntime.main()\n    /usr/local/go/src/runtime/proc.go:172 +0x280 fp=0x442003bf90 sp=0x442003bf40\nruntime.goexit()\n    /usr/local/go/src/runtime/asm_arm64.s:983 +0x4 fp=0x442003bf90 sp=0x442003bf90\n\nr0      0x442003bbb8\nr1      0x4420130040\nr2      0x1ffc0\nr3      0x881100\nr4      0x8\nr5      0x8\nr6      0x442003bbb8\nr7      0x4420130000\nr8      0x10e\nr9      0x10\nr10     0x8776e0\nr11     0x0\nr12     0x8\nr13     0x0\nr14     0x0\nr15     0x10\nr16     0x442003bdb8\nr17     0x87ae78\nr18     0x0\nr19     0x0\nr20     0x0\nr21     0x0\nr22     0x0\nr23     0x0\nr24     0x0\nr25     0x0\nr26     0x87ad50\nr27     0xb2dd19\nr28     0x44200001a0\nr29     0x0\nlr      0x3684c8\nsp      0x442003bb80\npc      0x368ebc\nfault   0x0\n```\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"I decided I didn't need ~5GB of stuff on my desktop, so I deleted some of it while Syncthing was uploading to a remote backup server.\n\n![This is what I saw on the remote's Syncthing GUI.](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6668965/18539881/e218418e-7ad7-11e6-9df9-d6bbeb237e93.png)\n\nIt got over 830%, and refreshing didn't fix.

No wrapper to resurrect it.\n\nInspecting ST's folder on that machine revealed a fat list of temporary binaries (all are bit-wise copies of 0.14.4):\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11633330/17636561/9be4a848-60e6-11e6-97f8-42b510f84b04.png)\nLogs are similar to the first machine:\n\n```\n ...\n [IDIDID] 19:10:36 INFO: Device IDIDIDID-08 folder \"FOLDER-48\" has a new index ID (0xF09B1B83A25B09E5)\n [IDIDID] 19:10:47 WARNING: Automatic upgrade: rename C:\\Program Files\\Syncthing-Service\\Service\\syncthing767851213 C:\\Program Files\\Syncthing-Service\\Service\\syncthing.exe: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.\n [IDIDID] 19:11:28 INFO: Connection to IDIDIDID-08 closed: switching connections\n [IDIDID] 19:11:28 INFO: Established secure connection to IDIDIDID-08 at LOCAL-IPv4-01.3:22000-LOCAL-IPv4-01.2:58038 (TCP (Server))\n [IDIDID] 19:11:28 INFO: Device IDIDIDID-08 client is \"syncthing v0.14.4\" named \"DEVICE-08\"\n [IDIDID] 19:11:28 INFO: Connected to device IDIDIDID-08 with a newer version (current \"v0.14.3\" < remote \"v0.14.4\").

Oftentimes they are a result from erring on some Syncthing share algebra, but the fact that it's happened twice in the past couple months could be cause for concern. In those instances, a popup warning that lets us know something along the lines of \"Continuing with what you are doing could result in an infinite directory loop!\" would have been really nice to keep us from making a that terrible mistake.\n\nIf you can't pull the directory structure at share creation, then maybe while it's starting its initial sync, run some pattern recognition that kills the sync process for the affected shares?

However, Method 2 does not work.  In fact, the folders that have been shared via Method 1 do not show up as selected in the device menu.

E.g. If Syncthing-inotify performs `scan?folder=default&sub=foo/bar&sub=foo/bar2` because the files `bar` and `bar2` are removed, the file count is reduced by 3 instead of 2. I traced it back to the fact that we use a [`batch`](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/29fa05ae0580e9a707171af7f0b00de6b92a5be8/lib/model/model.go#L1486) array instead of a map, which means the array we pass to updateLocals can contain duplicates.

We rsync from the source-of-truth into the pool, syncthing-inotify notices the changes and informs syncthing.  Syncthing then fans out the data nicely.  All the syncthing nodes are a mesh of peers, the rsync forces them to converge if there's a problem.\n\nAfter our change from 0.12.13 to 0.12.19 we are now seeing dropped updates.   I provoked an update by deleting several directory trees and updating the indexes and signatures.  When the rsync happened, the inotify logs look correct and it appears that syncthing was correctly informed.\n\n```\n# touch index.txt ; touch *.sig\n.... \n[OK] 00:55:00 Syncthing is indexing change in admin-built: [amd64_10.txt.sig amd64_11.txt.sig amd64_9.txt.sig i386_10.txt.sig i386_11.txt.sig ia64_10.txt.sig index.txt index.txt.sig sparc64_10.txt.sig]\n```\n\nThe line in syncthing-inotify's log appears to correctly show that syncthing has received the correct notifications and has acknowledge them all correctly.\n\nHowever, the result is this on the master (the mesh peer receiving the updates):\n\n```\n-rw-r--r--  1 syncthing  syncthing  3421 Mar 17 23:53 index.txt\n-rw-r--r--  1 syncthing  syncthing   512 Mar 17 23:53 index.txt.sig\n-rw-r--r--  1 syncthing  syncthing   512 Mar 17 23:53 amd64_9.txt.sig\n-rw-r--r--  1 syncthing  syncthing   512 Mar 17 23:53 amd64_10.txt.sig\n```\n\nBut the rest of the mesh has:\n\n```\n-rw-r--r--  1 syncthing  syncthing  3421 Mar 17 23:53 index.txt\n-rw-r--r--  1 syncthing  syncthing   512 Mar 17 23:48 index.txt.sig\n-rw-r--r--  1 syncthing  syncthing   512 Mar 17 23:53 amd64_9.txt.sig\n-rw-r--r--  1 syncthing  syncthing   512 Mar 17 23:53 amd64_10.txt.sig\n```\n\nThe problematic file is \"index.txt.sig\". \n\nThe gui reports everything is in sync.  If I hit a 'rescan all' on the master, then the missing changes are discovered and the mesh resyncs. \n\n.stignore on the \"master\" mesh peer looks like this:\n\n```\n// rsync in-flight transfers\n// eg: foo.txz is transferred as .foo.txz.23yXh3\n.*\n```\n\nAnother example, this time not using rsync at all.

GUI reports all peers 100% in sync.\n\nThen I hit the 'rescan' button for the admin-built collection, and re-checked the peers:\n\n```\nroot@syncthing.ysv:~syncthing/built # ls -lrtT foo*\n-rw-r--r--  1 syncthing  syncthing  0 Mar 18 01:05:18 2016 foo.txt.sig\n-rw-r--r--  1 syncthing  syncthing  0 Mar 18 01:05:18 2016 foo.txt\n```\n\nIs there some magic involving suffixes that I'm not aware of?  Perhaps there's a prefix/suffix bug in notification handlers inside syncthing?\n\nWhat should I do next to track this down?\n\nPS: If I don't use a common prefix, eg: \"foo.txt and foo.sig\" instead of \"foo.txt and foo.txt.sig\" then it works.\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"In my mind, the bug is that STGUIASSETS should no longer point to the same hierachy that we compile in, and that the behavior is different when overriding vs when not.

Compiled in asset $THEME/$PATH\n3. Compiled in asset default/$PATH\n\nI think it would be cleaner if we instead looked for\n1. $STGUIASSETS/$THEME/$PATH\n2. Compiled in asset $THEME/$PATH\n3. $STGUIASSETS/default/$PATH\n4.

A (small) complication is that the theme selector would need to pick up themes present both in the compiled in assets and in the potential overridden assetsDir.\n\nFrom a development point of view, I think pointing STGUIASSETS at the gui dir in the source checkout should result in it working exactly as normal, except that anything in there can be overridden regardless of theme etc. It's just that I haven't noticed this is not the case because I haven't done nay GUI dev work lately :)\n\n(https://github.com/syncthing/docs/pull/132)\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"Hi, \n\nI use two monitors and when I started syncthing, I couldn't recognize the Folder ID and the Path (see screenshot) (because of the bad contrast and different angle of my second monitor).

From my tests, I discovered that setting keepTemporariesH to 0 prevent the problem, but I am not sure this is the ideal solution.\n\nMy understanding is that temporary files are kept only when the transfer does not complete, and this is clearly not the case. So, I wonder:\n1) why temporary files are kept in this case\n2) what I can do to correctly prevent/solve the problem.\n\nThank you.\n![screenshot1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13137622/12530789/899c4a2e-c1ea-11e5-9df3-04933be8f04f.png)\n![screenshot2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13137622/12530791/89a1168a-c1ea-11e5-8540-30059fcc8801.png)\n![screenshot3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13137622/12530790/899e8c12-c1ea-11e5-914a-d161dd3e7f65.png)\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"[UBCXW] 11:16:58 INFO: Puller (folder \"GameBackups\", file \"Company of Heroes 2\\Disk_1\\231440_depotcache_7.csm\"): delete: mkdir \\?\\E:\\GameBackups.stversions: Access is denied.\n\nGetting a pile of these on one of my folders since updating to the latest version. \nIs there a fix coming for this?\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"Hi Guys\n\nI am running Syncthing on one of my Windows 7 machines at work and it doesn't seem to connect to other devices as quickly as the linux machines.

It should be used only for nonrecoverable errors - config error, or potentially the new checksum mismatch error.\n\nAlternatively we could just refuse to load the config when it's broken in this manner, have `CheckFolderHealth` handle the missing path case (it probably already does) and remove the `Invalid` thing altogether?\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"I've been noticing troublesome behaviour lately that started to occur since upgrading to 0.12.

Both machines are running Syncthing through SyncTrayzor 1.0.29.\n\nSometimes, when I change the name of a folder that contains files/more folders on my PC, Syncthing on the other PC begins to completely redownload all the files into the new folder and then deletes the old folder and its contents afterwards, instead of creating a new folder and moving the existing files there. The same happens to file renames.\n\nThe same goes for changing files, instead of downloading only the changed blocks, Syncthing on the remote PC downloads the entire file and replaces the old one.\n\nThis appears to happen randomly as I've seen a few occassions where changing folder/file names does gets handled as expected. I wonder if anyone else has noticed something similar happening.

Since relaying is disabled, we have `var relaySvc *relay.Svc` in main which is nil, that we then pass to the discovery service. But the discovery service takes a `discovery.relayStatusProvider` interface. Since we're passing a _variable_ that is nil, and not a nil _literal_, the other side gets a \"typed nil\" interface, so the check in there for `relayStatusProvide == nil` ends up being false even though the interface contains a nil pointer.\n\nThe cleanest way is probably\n\n```\nif relaySvc == nil {\n    disc = discover.NewDiscoverer(myID, opts.ListenAddress, nil)\n} else {\n    disc = discover.NewDiscoverer(myID, opts.ListenAddress, relaySvc)\n}\n```\n\nin main.go, but goddamn that looks like crap...\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"During my activity, sometimes I delete just created files.\n\nNow I have an \"Out of Sync\" with 26 items failed.\n\nEvery file is in \"no such file or directory\"\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"All devices show as Disconnected in the WebUI.

It's about 8GB of changes, but sync speed doesn't even seem to be the bottleneck. The machines haven't yet figured out what's different between them.

I don't know too much about IPv6 yet, but on stack overflow it is claimed that the Syncthing multicast address (ff32::5222), as specified in https://github.com/syncthing/specs/blob/master/DISCOVERYv2.md, is reserved for future use (referring to http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-multicast-addresses/ipv6-multicast-addresses.xhtml#unicast-multicast-group-ids). \n\nCould someone with enough knowledge on this have a look at it?

As it stands, the Ignore Patterns functionality can't be managed via the Web UI on these sorts of devices.\n\nI also tried this via web browsers and could access the buttons on the Nexus 7, but not the HTC One.\nScreenshot:\n![screenshot_2015-07-08-20-22-13](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4228567/8579990/e75cd52a-25af-11e5-98de-e59fce12fda9.png)\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"Syncthing 0.11.13 appears to generate two DeviceConnected events per connection.

This is a problem as I have a shared folder between multiple users all in a common group and I would like to keep all newly created folders owned by that group. As it stands, I have a top folder called `music` with permissions `drwxrwsr-x+`, when Syncthing creates a sub-folder `Queen` that folder does not inherit setguid and instead has permissions `drwxrwxr-x+` (note that it should be `drwxrwsr-x+`). This is a problem as when Syncthing creates a sub-folder of `Queen`, `Queen/Jazz` that folder now has syncthing as it's group as opposed to `media`, the shared group I would like. Now other users cannot access `Queen/Jazz`.\n\nI have tried creating folders and files on the command line under different user accounts and everything is working as I expect so I'm confident I've set up my permissions, groups and ACLs correctly and hence why I suspect this is an issue in Syncthing.\n\nI may also be able to submit a pull request to fix this but I would greatly appreciate a few pointers towards the relevant areas of code that I should look at.\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"Hi!\nNoticed strange behavior when unmount/mount external HDD:\n- Folder on a node B synchronized with folder on external HDD on node A\n- external HDD on node A have been unmounted\n- Folder on node B was changed (for example, I delete 1 file)\n- mount HDD again to node A\n- deleted file appears on node B again\n  So, seems like when external HDD mounted again, all files on it counted as new and are being synced back to other nodes, even if they were modified/deleted previously.\n  I noticed, that when I delete file on node B during external drive was disconnected from node A, Syncthing on node A get that (I see \"delete file <..>\" in folder status on node A), but when external HDD mounted back, that change doesn't being applied.\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"short question:\nIs there a special reason, why it's not possible to edit an Ignore Pattern list from a computers browser, where the syncthing install is not local, or can this be considered as a bug?\n\nlong explanation:\n-Computer A with installed syncthing v0.11.9, Windows (64 bit), FireFox 38.0.5 browser and tab with URL http://ip_to_computer_B/ pointing to computer B.\n\n-Computer B with installed syncting v0.11.9, Mac OS X (32 bit)\n\n-ip_to_computer_A is 192.168.1.10:8384\n-ip_to_computer_B is 192.168.1.20:8384\n\nWhen trying to edit the Ignore Pattern list of any configured and already saved folder from computer B using the browser from computer A, the Ignore Patterns-button is greyed out and not clickable.\n(glitchy behaviour btw: sometimes the button clickable, but with no result other than greying that button out after the click)\n\nWhat I expected to happen: \nIgnore Patterns List would open up and be editable in the browsers window.\n\nWhen on computer B with same browserversion, using the webgui via URL ip_to_computer_B or 127.0.0.1:8384 everything works as expected (list opens and user can edit).\n\nSummary:\nits not possible to edit an Ignore Pattern list of another syncthing installation from another computer in the LAN.

(I'm guessing, I don't know Go and I don't know how Syncthing handles startup)\n\nThis issue can be reproduced by directly editing config.xml or by changing the value through the web UI, and will be triggered upon the next start up.\n\nI've only tested this on v0.11.9, Linux (64 bit).\n"},{"labels":["bug",null],"text":"Thread where I first reported this problem: https://forum.syncthing.net/t/deleted-file-causing-issues/3039\n\nHope this isn't a duplicate - had a look but I may have missed the obvious.\n\nCreated a folder structure within a shared folder. Immediately used WinRAR to turn it into an archive, within this time, syncthing had indexed and shared some of those files, it then treated those files as a delete once the entire was sent to the .rar archive. This caused issues and the dreaded pausing puller... on at least two of my devices (a windows laptop - the one i made the changes on, and a pi, the rest of my devices I don't currently have access to)\n\nPoints to note - the files that were being archived were the syncthing config files (minus the index databases) in case I wanted to rebuild from scratch.

Wait for a while and Test2.txt appears on B. Test1.txt on B is still empty. This is normal as Test1.txt is in A's ignore list now so A will not transfer any content update of Test1.txt. This proves the ignore pattern on A is correct and working.\n 7. Delete Test1.txt from A. Wait for a while.\n 8. The Override Change button appears on A. Click the Out of Sync link on A will list Test1.txt. This is normal as B has Test1.txt but A though it don't have(because ignored).\n 9. Click the override button on A. It will disappear for one second but back again in the next second. You can click the override button again and again, it always comes back. The Test1.txt is always listed as out of sync. The Test1.txt file never get deleted on B. This is not normal, and this is the issue I'm talking about.\n 10. Create empty file Test3.txt on **B**.\n 11.
