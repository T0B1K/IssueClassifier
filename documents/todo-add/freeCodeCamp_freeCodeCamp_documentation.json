For example, [How to work on coding challenges](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/how-to-work-on-coding-challenges.md) only shows a template with no solution.  [The Style guide](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/style-guide-for-curriculum-challenges.md), unsurprisingly, covers formatting, but not content.  \r\n\r\nIt might be worth clarifying that what has to go into a solution.  I managed to convince myself that all a solution needed to do was pass the tests, since that would allow the tests to be as fast as possible.  @RandellDawson pointed out that it's standard practice to base the solution on the full seed code and only make the modifications required to pass the tests.  i.e. that the solution should be one that a user is likely to come up with.

    "text": "#### Issue Description\r\nA number of users setting up a local dev copy of freeCodeCamp have posted in Gitter with difficulties getting a working sign-up link using Mailhog.\r\n\r\nThe root cause seems to be the provided instructions are not clear enough. Specifically this line `To access your MailHog inbox, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8025. ` is being missed by users due to it appearing to be in the Linux specific setup instructions rather than applicable to all users.  \r\n\r\nThese users are therefore attempting to use a link copied out of the console window in which Mailhog is running. However this provides a `source` view of the email which is in an encoded form.\r\n\r\nThis means that a simple copy and paste into browser will fail as the encoded version has '=' replaced by '=3D' and soft line breaks (represented by an = symbol) inserted to keep line length below 76 characters.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26827682/39624992-66fdb834-4f93-11e8-8ed0-a8896c70e4a2.png)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is possible they miss this entry in the console and try and pull a link out of further up the console output where the link is also polluted with end of line characters (eg \\r\\n) and the ampersand is represented in unicode - \\u0026. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26827682/39625196-4bf52210-4f94-11e8-815f-8dac38eb16eb.png)\r\n\r\nSee also comment on issue #15838:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26827682/39625453-5db91622-4f95-11e8-8e64-3def4330ce48.png)\r\n\r\nThe solution is just to provide clearer instructions to ensure use of the MailHog WebUI, in which there is a  clickable link available in the plain text view provided. I've tested both 32bit and 64bit Mailhog executables on Win 7 and have confirmed behaviour is identical between the two versions.\r\n\r\nI'll write up my changes to Contributing.md later today and raise a PR.\r\n"

    "text": "Hi there,\r\n\r\n@raisedadead and I will be working on the freeCodeCamp API. The code will be located in a separate repository, at the moment https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/open-api . The current project boards have been created on a repository instead of organisational level. As freeCodeCamp moves away from the current monolithic architecture it will be more common to have projects that span multiple repositories.\r\n\r\nI propose that we move, migrate or reproduce https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/projects/5 from github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCam (tied to the  freeCodeCamp *repository*) to the github.com/freeCodeCamp *organisation*.\r\n\r\nSee Github doco at https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards:\r\n> Organization-wide project boards can contain issues and pull requests from any repository that belongs to an organization.\r\n"

    "text": "I would like to propose freeCodeCamp's CSS Style guide to improve overall maintainability of the codebase. As the FreeCodeCamp has a lot of contributors, and everyone writes the CSS in a different way. And it is hard to keep of track of different ways of writing CSS.\r\n\r\n### Initial Recommendations:\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\n\r\n- Add comments, when you are starting a new LESS file, so the developers know what are they working with, also add comments when you start new section which is related the code block, it helps with the readability, see **EXAMPLES** below (I have encountered these style of comments across the code base, therefore I would like to continue writing it, instead of proposing a new style)\r\n\r\n- **Example 1 - when starting a new LESS file:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n//\r\n// Navigation\r\n// --------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **Example 2 - when adding a section, related to navigation**\r\n\r\n```\r\n//\r\n// Navigation - Mobile Styles\r\n// ------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Spacings\r\n\r\n- Add spaces after a property, it will be much easier to read such a codebase, and maintain. See **EXAMPLES** below.\r\n\r\n- **Example 1 - Correct Way**\r\n\r\n```\r\np {\r\n  color: #fff;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **Example 2 - Incorrect Way**\r\n- **What is wrong?**\r\nNo space after a colon\r\n\r\n```\r\np {\r\n  color:#fff;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Colors\r\n\r\n- Prefer lowercase, instead of uppercase. Now across the CSS, contributors are mixing both. Lower case is faster to write, easier to read. Again improves overall maintainability, if the CSS has consistent convention. Also if possible shorten the hex value. See **EXAMPLES** below.\r\n\r\n- **Example 1 - Correct Way**\r\n\r\n```\r\np {\r\n  color: #fff;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **Example 2 - Incorrect Way**\r\n- **What is wrong?**\r\nupper-cased hex value, not shortened\r\n\r\n```\r\np {\r\n  color: #FFFFFF;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## RGBA or RGB colors\r\n- Add spaces after values, improves readability. See **EXAMPLES** below:\r\n\r\n- **EXAMPLE 1 - Correct Way**\r\n\r\n```\r\np {\r\n  color: rgba(123, 123, 0, 0.1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **EXAMPLE 2 - Incorrect Way**\r\n- **What is wrong?**\r\nNo spaces after values\r\n\r\n```\r\np {\r\n  color: rgba(123,123,0,0.1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n##No unit when declaring 0\r\n\r\n- In property such as box-shadow, if you set a 0 value, then you should avoid adding the unit. See **EXAMPLE** below.\r\n\r\n- **EXAMPLE 1 - Correct Way**\r\n\r\n```\r\np {\r\n  box-shadow: 1px 1px 0 rgb(0, 0, 0);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **EXAMPLE 2 - Incorrect Way**\r\n- **What is wrong?**\r\nUnits after 0\r\n\r\n```\r\np {\r\n  box-shadow: 1px 1px 0px rgb(0, 0, 0);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Avoid floating numbers\r\n- If possible you should avoid floating numbers in CSS for different sizing, as it could render a bit differently. See link attached below.\r\n\r\n[Browser Rounding](http://cruft.io/posts/percentage-calculations-in-ie/)\r\n  "

In many instances, I've ended up playing with something that was marked as Help Wanted and unassigned and in the Todo bucket, only to realize that someone else was working on it!\r\n\r\nWork-items should reflect current and accurate status. I would like to see the following:\r\n\r\n1. People working on issues need to be assigned to it, or at least a note stating that a specific person is investigating needs to be posted.\r\n\r\n2. The issue must be moved to in-progress (or in an investigating bucket)\r\n\r\n3.

This would help us teach campers so much better, and in the process help us shape our own sass contents. Right? no?
