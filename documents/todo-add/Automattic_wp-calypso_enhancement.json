We discussed which of those things should be respected in an intentionally style-neutral environment such as the Reader at https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS/issues/13930#issuecomment-615465956 and the consensus was that we should not support color changes in the Reader but we are open to supporting alignment. \r\n\r\nIn another `wp-calypso` issue at https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/43595#issuecomment-653341158, it was suggested that headings should be displayed with the correct size and alignment, but not colors, to respect some styles the content creator has added while still keeping the Reader's look.\r\n\r\nIn my experience talking with users, centering would be the most wanted.\r\n\r\nFrom a maintenance perspective, I can see not supporting only center-aligned text because left-aligned or right-aligned text could change the flow of the document in unexpected ways. Centered text does seem to be a use case that could benefit the fundamental reading flow of a document without unwanted side effects, and this also applies (probably more strongly) to other blocks such as buttons, quotes, and images. My recommendation would be to support centering and it's up to you which blocks should support center-alignment and which should not—for example, you could decide to allow centering to work for buttons, quotes, and images but not for paragraphs.\r\n\r\n#perspective #manual-testing #user-report "},{"labels":[null,"enhancement"],"text":"<!-- Thanks for contributing to Calypso!

A Starter Design is …\r\n\r\n1. A Theme selection.\r\n2. The page content.\r\n3.

We would likely require some new Taxonomies to be registered alongside the existing ones.\r\n\r\n- Theme name\r\n- Font settings\r\n- Demo site URL\r\n- Screenshot\r\n\r\nThe API would look for those taxonomies.

It will depend on Patterns API work, so the scope of this will likely change.\r\n\r\n* [ ] The page layout picker currently loads the page templates server-side via an API call and attaches them to the initial page load in [the `starterPageTemplatesConfig` object](https://github.com/automattic/wp-calypso/blob/2b83937b085691ba66d162c35ca4a28ff48a5ce4/apps/full-site-editing/full-site-editing-plugin/starter-page-templates/class-starter-page-templates.php#L181). Right now this is adding around 463kb to our initial page load for the editor when loading it with the page layout picker.\r\n  - Explore lazy-loading this template data after the initial page load\r\n  - Can we move to having two API calls, one to get the list of available page layouts (similar to how we list available designs in Gutenboarding), and one to grab the block markup for _just_ the selected page layout? This should support having a growing list of available page layouts, without slowing down the initial page load or browsing page layouts\r\n* [ ] When the list of available page layouts is first rendered ([renderTemplatesList](https://github.com/automattic/wp-calypso/blob/39ed68c25110278412f8dfa753e99562dd84beab/apps/full-site-editing/full-site-editing-plugin/starter-page-templates/page-template-modal/index.js#L317)) , the memoized function [`getBlocksByTemplateSlugs` is called](https://github.com/automattic/wp-calypso/blob/39ed68c25110278412f8dfa753e99562dd84beab/apps/full-site-editing/full-site-editing-plugin/starter-page-templates/page-template-modal/index.js#L57) — this is a computationally expensive function that iterates through all of the loaded templates and parses the blocks. However, we probably only need to parse blocks when we wish to preview or use them — can this logic be moved to occur only when a user selects a particular layout?  This might help performance on low-powered devices / older browsers\r\n* [ ] Previews — currently the thumbnail previews are static images, and the larger preview is using a `<BlockEditorProvider>` and `<BlockList>` to [render the preview](https://github.com/automattic/wp-calypso/blob/34169f274c2191623f333824ecbe4b8835bc6ea3/apps/full-site-editing/full-site-editing-plugin/starter-page-templates/page-template-modal/components/block-preview.js#L31) from an array of blocks. This approach mirrors Gutenberg's [`<BlockPreview>` component](https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg/blob/153817e3493e5ca3518f913d9ff859aab6e9a3e4/packages/block-editor/src/components/block-preview/index.js#L35), but is this the best way to go about previewing a block pattern / page layout?

One idea [I mentioned here](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/pull/39334#issuecomment-585290812) would be to include a sliding scale for price filtering, but further discussion with Product and Marketing is needed to assess what we need to design for.\r\n\r\ncc @olaolusoga "},{"labels":[null,"enhancement"],"text":"Before a user installs a third-party plugin or theme on a private Simple site, they're shown a warning that prompts them to set the site to public.

Starting at My Site -> Manage -> Domains → Add Domain\r\n2. Register a new domain to an existing site you own\r\n3. Later, you realize what's happened and you go to start a new site at https://wordpress.com/start \r\n4.

It's important we keep the top bar clear, and concise so users know it is solely used for high level document management. If we allow any UI component in the top bar it will degrade the experience to the point that the top bar loses value, and importance. By cleaning up the noise in the top bar, creating guidelines, make things contextual, and introducing mechanisms that will keep the order, we can ensure that the top bar component will continue to evolve in a self sustaining way.\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\nThe top bar is an important component in the Gutenberg editor experience. It contains contains document-level actions like Editor mode, save status, global actions for undo/redo/insert, the settings toggle, and publish options.\r\n\r\nAs the editor, and Gutenberg continues to expand, we need to keep the top bar free from unnecessary UI components—from core, and 3rd party plugins— that reduce its importance. \r\n\r\nWith dotcom buidling a custom editor based off core gutenberg parts, we can improve the UX, serving a stronger, more streamlines exp.\r\n\r\n**Example of top bar noise**\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-01-22 at 1 21 33 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1382943/72931428-d5ea1f80-3d2b-11ea-8314-3f9baa5507fe.png)\r\n"},{"labels":["enhancement"],"text":"Many users don't realize that everything they put into the Media Library can be accessed by anyone.\r\n\r\nI believe we should explicitly inform users that content uploaded to the Media Library is Public.

Clone `Automattic/wp-calypso`\r\n2. Run `npm install`\r\n3. Run `npm run lint:js`\r\n\r\n#### Performance Analysis\r\nESLint will generate a report of the top ten longest-running rules when run with the `TIMING=1` environment variable (see documentation [here](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-rules#per-rule-performance)). Here is the report generated for `master`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRule                              | Time (ms) | Relative\r\n:---------------------------------|----------:|--------:\r\nimport/no-extraneous-dependencies | 42270.496 |    39.7%\r\nimport/no-nodejs-modules          | 30388.073 |    28.5%\r\nreact/no-deprecated               | 10202.986 |     9.6%\r\nreact/no-string-refs              |  4528.707 |     4.2%\r\nreact/prefer-es6-class            |  3550.438 |     3.3%\r\nno-unused-vars                    |  2469.957 |     2.3%\r\nvalid-jsdoc                       |   972.121 |     0.9%\r\nno-regex-spaces                   |   546.561 |     0.5%\r\njest/no-identical-title           |   441.417 |     0.4%\r\nreact-hooks/rules-of-hooks        |   397.941 |     0.4%\r\n```\r\n\r\nRoughly 50% of the current run is being eaten up by two rules from the `eslint-plugin-import` plugin (percentages below are out of the total time spent executing rules):\r\n\r\n- `import/no-extraneous-imports` is ~40%\r\n- `import/no-nodejs-modules` is ~29%\r\n\r\nDisabling these rules cuts the run time down from ~4m to ~2m on my machine (with a fresh run after deleting the cache). I’ve never used these two rules myself and I’m not finding much when I try to Google/GitHub Search for others who have ran into this issue.\r\n\r\n#### Possible solutions\r\n1. Disable the two rules. This obviously isn't ideal, but it might be useful to re-evaluate what problem these rules are trying to solve and if it's worth the trade-off of the longer linting run.\r\n1. Spend some time digging into the rules and seeing if we can submit some performance optimization patches upstream. My (naive) guess is that these rules are slower because they are doing file I/O operations.\r\n1. Use editor integrations or a Git commit hook that only runs on staged files for linting in dev and run the full linting job in CI. It looks like there is already a hook, but this wouldn't work right now because there are errors in `master`. However, if those were cleaned up, this could be a good balance of ensuring that all the rules are run on the whole codebase while not lowering the velocity of the local dev environment too much. There would still be a bottleneck at the CI run step, but I personally have found that not to be as much of a hindrance in the projects I've worked on.\r\n\r\n#### Context / Source\r\n<!-- Optional: share your unique context to help us understand your perspective.

The language is the exact same as when editing a page/post.\r\n4. Public/Private, \"Publish\"/Draft.\r\n\r\n#### What I expected\r\nThese terms don't really make sense when applied to blocks. It seems like you should just have \"Save\" or it just isn't saved.\r\n\r\nEven drafts don't make sense because the blocks aren't actually published publicly anywhere. There's zero drawback to just saving a block, versus having a draft. Save/Update covers all those bases.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Customizer, having the terms \"Published\"/\"Draft\" causes confusion for users. Anytime the word \"published\" is used users think of content specifically like posts, and updating their followers, the same way you'd publish a newspaper.\r\n\r\n#### What happened instead\r\nYou can select the different options such as \"private\".\r\n\r\nThe use of private in particular is a bit confusing, as it makes the block invisible to everyone. Even the person who created it. So it's not like you can create blocks that only a specific admin can see.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, all the regular post/page options are available via the \"three dot\" button.

There's also relevant work going on: https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/pull/35882)\r\n-  I honestly didn’t know what this was. It appears to be a block, but it’s not, and I can’t delete it? It’s a convenient link to preview my site, but it’s also confusing because it’s a block that isn’t showing up on the preview? I created a brand new page, and this same block appeared to be a page heading, but why is it needed for the Home page when it's not functioning like it should?\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2019-10-01 11 45 56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4924246/65994480-36391680-e448-11e9-8632-3c68c765c855.png)\r\n\r\n- I’m not seeing my site title in preview mode for the Home page.

They have a WordPress.com account registered at their own email address the company provided. They'll soon leave the company and they want to transfer their account ownership to their colleague. So they change their account's email address at https://wordpress.com/me/account to the one of their colleague's. Their colleague receives an email, clicks on the link to confirm it, and gets redirected to the login screen. There's no message what to do and they have a choice to either login or register. On the other hand, the email address change wasn't completed and the account owner still sees at https://wordpress.com/me/account that the email address change is pending.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Starting at URL: https://wordpress.com/me/account\r\n2. Change the email address of the account\r\n3. When the confirmation email arrives at the inbox of the new email, open the link in a browser where you aren't logged into a WordPress.com account.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"776\" alt=\"screen-shot-2019-09-28-at-10 16 12-pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10340370/65959181-a1d3b180-e451-11e9-8c8b-4376929b8e6a.png\">\r\n\r\n4.

The email address change wasn't completed and there's no message indicating that something went wrong. In the case I described above, the new user might just register a new account.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the email address change doesn’t cover this scenario^^. The most often case is that the owner of the old email and the new email is the same person but in cases of corporate accounts, this is not covered.\r\n\r\n#### What I expected\r\n\r\nIf the user confirming the email change isn't logged into the old owner's account, I'd expect to see a message - _Please log into the account account_name to complete the email address change._ - or similar. Also, when we take a look at the email that's sent to the new email address, the email doesn't suggest at any point that they need to be logged in to that account. Instead, the whole email feels like - this user wants to change the email address of their account to your email address. Click to confirm.\r\n\r\n#### What happened instead\r\n\r\nThe email address wasn't changed and there's no message indicating the next steps.\r\n\r\n#flowsharing\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPLEASE NOTE\r\n- These comments won't show up when you submit the issue.\r\n- Everything is optional, but try to add as many details as possible.\r\n\r\nDocs & troubleshooting:\r\nhttps://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\nhttps://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md\r\n\r\nHelpful tips for screenshots:\r\nhttps://en.support.wordpress.com/make-a-screenshot/\r\n-->\r\n"},{"labels":[null,null,null,"enhancement",null],"text":"Since two years ago Core [filters out](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/41937) cropped images from the Media Library, while Calypso's Media Library does not.

The images will then appear to _disappear_ when the old hosting expires.\r\n\r\nAn example of this happening can be found in p2EDhh-R5-p2. The user moved to WP.com from Le Monde's blog service, after Le Monde announced it was closing. Everything appeared to be working correctly until Le Monde completely deleted all content that had previously been hosted with them. The user now has no way to recover all of their missing images.  \r\n\r\n#### A Possible Solution\r\n\r\nIt may be helpful to display a dismissible warning in the editor if there’s more than one hot-linked image in a post. This warning would inform users that the images referenced in their post aren't actually present in their site's Media Library.\r\n\r\nSuch a warning may prompt users to get in touch sooner, while their old sites are still online and we're able to better help them recover the images.\r\n\r\n#### Context / Source\r\n\r\n#perspective #user-report\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional: share your unique context to help us understand your perspective.
