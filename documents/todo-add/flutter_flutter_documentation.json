Example [can be found here](https://developer.jwplayer.com/jwplayer/docs/jw8-javascript-api-reference#section-jwplayer-div-setup-options).  \r\nI want to integrate the HTML div element **into Flutter** to achieve the same effect that `video_player` does.\r\n\r\n### HTML equivalent\r\n\r\nThis is **everything** required to make the whole player work:\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// In head:\r\n// <script src=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/libraries/cdD21GnT.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n// In body:\r\n// <div id=\"jw-player-example\"></div>\r\n\r\n// In JS:\r\njwplayer(\"jw-player-example\").setup({file: \"https://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/VKDKBLZm.m3u8\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nI only want to do this and have the `div` in an `HTMLElementView`, but Flutter seems to be doing something that makes this not work.\r\n\r\n\r\n## It does not work in Flutter\r\n\r\nThe concept seems straight forward, however, there is a big problem: JW Player does not seem t obe happy with how Flutter inserts DOM elements, i.e. Flutter inserts them into a ***shadow DOM***.  \r\nThe [`jwplayer` function](https://github.com/jwplayer/jwplayer/blob/ff08b4c3e0a24a5f27ebb1b2dfac46217d56da38/src/js/jwplayer.js#L22) actually does not only accept strings - it also [accepts DOM elements directly](https://github.com/jwplayer/jwplayer/blob/ff08b4c3e0a24a5f27ebb1b2dfac46217d56da38/src/js/jwplayer.js#L42). However, I have no idea how to pass the element I create to that function.  \r\n\r\nBelow I will showcase a few approaches that _did not work_:\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nconst viewType = 'jw-player-view';\r\n\r\nfinal div = DivElement()..id = viewType;\r\n\r\n// ignore: UNDEFINED_PREFIXED_NAME\r\nui.platformViewRegistry.registerViewFactory(\r\n  viewType,\r\n  (int viewId) => div,\r\n);\r\n\r\n// jwplayer(\"jw-player-view\")\r\n(js.context['jwplayer'] as js.JsFunction).apply([viewType]);\r\n// Does not work because the element is created in the shadow DOM.\r\n\r\n// jwplayer(div)\r\n(js.context['jwplayer'] as js.JsFunction).apply([div]);\r\n// Seems to kind of work to some extent (no exception), but the player does not appear\r\n// to really do anything to the actual DOM element because it probably is only an object\r\n// that does not actually point to the dom. jwplayer().getContainer() will reveal a \"jw-flag-play-rejected\".\r\n\r\n// jwplayer(document.getElementsByTagName('flt-platform-view')[0].shadowRoot.querySelector('#jw-player-view'))\r\n// This seems the most promising, but I can only get it to work from the JS console and it\r\n// has the problem of not displaying anything in any way again.\r\n// I assume that the CSS that should apply does not reach the element because it is in the shadow DOM.\r\n\r\n\r\ndocument.getElementsByTagName('flt-platform-view')[0].append(_div);\r\n// Does not seem to add the element to the DOM and more importantly I will not be able to use it\r\n// in a HTMLElementView.\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Putting the script into the shadow DOM\r\n\r\nI saw that @hterkelsen proposed the following [in a similar seeming issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/40080#issuecomment-531040550):\r\n\r\n> If you want to bundle JS with your platform view, you could register a `BodyElement` with a `ScriptElement`. Will this give you the functionality you need?\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Click to see the problem with that</summary>\r\n\r\nI had two problems with that: first of all, I did not get it to work with the `platformViewRegistry`:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nfinal body = BodyElement()..id = 'BODYELEMENTID';\r\n\r\nfinal script = ScriptElement()\r\n  // Inserts cloud hosted JW Player into the shadow DOM.\r\n  ..src = 'https://cdn.jwplayer.com/libraries/ID.js';\r\n\r\nbody.insertAdjacentElement('afterBegin', script);\r\n\r\n// ignore: UNDEFINED_PREFIXED_NAME\r\nui.platformViewRegistry.registerViewFactory(\r\n  'shadow-body',\r\n  (int viewId) => body,\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not do anything - so I do not really have an idea how to use it. It seems that I first need to return it\r\nto an `HTMLElementView`, but that does also not really seem to help.\r\n\r\nMore importantly however, even when I inserted the element from the JS console, it as though the\r\n`jwplayer` object was still part of the main document and **still not able to access the div element**.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\nIs there any way I can make JW Player accept the HTML elements created in Flutter?  \r\n\r\n1. Is there a way to achieve this currently?  \r\n2. Is there maybe even a way to **not use** a shadow DOM if we want?"

We created a BackdropFilter widget to satisfy a common use of that technique, but there were other uses for which it was not as suited, such as blurring a widget in isolation. It is possible to use BackdropFilter to achieve those other results, but the construction is not obvious and there are a number of pitfalls that a developer can fall into.\r\n\r\nMore recently a new ImageFiltered widget was added which more directly serves the other needs to filter a part of an app with a more straightforward construction and an easier to manage behavior. But, developers continue to use BackdropFilter as it has been around longer and has more awareness built for it.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nDocument the existence of the two widgets in each other's doc comments and provide examples and guidance on when to use each."

Even more strange is that I restored key1  of `SingleChildScrollView` and `TextField` recover state too.\r\n\r\nRoot cause:\r\nThe root cause of that is `PageStorage ` distinguish widget by a chain of PageStorageKeys, so if modify the key of the middle chain, all the descendants will lose state.\r\nIn addition, repeated additions and deletions of a widget(different PageStorageKey) will cause `PageStorage._storage` memory leaks.

The errors above seems to say I'm missing runtime support. Does that mean FFI async callback is not included in the official dart/flutter releases?\r\n- Is there a ready-to-run ffi async callback sample or documentation somewhere?\r\n\r\nI'm afraid that with this little info, it would be too difficult to figure it out by trail-and-error.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/samples/ffi/async/sample_async_callback.dart"

It's as if the code is not actually synced to the device itself. \r\nI don't see any error in the console.

    "text": "As a plugin developer, I get numerous issues regarding this error on a regular basis. There are many unrelated causes for this error, and to make matters worse, the error message identifies the plugin that was attempting to use platform channels although that is not necessarily the plugin that is responsible for the error, and so you get issues posted by app developers on the wrong projects asking for the bug to be fixed. Furthermore, sometimes the error is caused by an incorrectly written plugin and other times it is caused by something the app developer did or didn't do. In both cases, there is a lack of documentation to help both the plugin developer and the app developer to navigate this issue and track down the root of what's causing it.\r\n\r\nWhat I think is sorely needed is an official MissingPluginException FAQ listing all of the causes for this error and how to address them.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since a lot of these errors can be caused whenever an app is creating a background FlutterEngine and it fails to register plugins for some reason, the documentation for Flutter background execution needs to be improved. The following page, for example, still refers to an old Medium article written by Ben Konyi that desperately needs an update:\r\n\r\nhttps://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/background-processes\r\n\r\nOn the Android side, the linked article has still not been updated to explain the v2 architecture and plugins that don't do this correctly may fail to do plugin registration correctly in certain circumstances. Yet, this is what the official Flutter documentation refers to.\r\n\r\nHere is something that I (as a plugin developer) cannot figure out from the documentation: In that medium article, Ben uses this callback trick on Android to allow plugins to be registered in the background, but it is not needed anymore under v2:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  // In a custom Application subclass\r\n  public void onCreate() {\r\n    super.onCreate();\r\n    GeofencingService.setPluginRegistrant(this);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the same article uses this trick in the iOS implementation:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application\r\n    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\r\n  // Register the plugins with the AppDelegate\r\n  registerPlugins(self);\r\n  // Set registerPlugins as a callback within GeofencingPlugin. This allows\r\n  // for the Geofencing plugin to register the plugins with the background\r\n  // FlutterEngine instance created to handle events. If this step is skipped,\r\n  // other plugins will not work in the geofencing callbacks!\r\n  [GeofencingPlugin setPluginRegistrantCallback:registerPlugins];\r\n\r\n  // Override point for customization after application launch.\r\n  return [super application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this trick still required in iOS but not required in Android? If I view the latest version of the geofencing plugin on GitHub, it still has this trick in it. However, the [flutter_isolate](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_isolate) plugin doesn't do this trick and STILL seems to work in almost most cases, although still people sometimes report that plugins do not get registered in some cases, and it is never obvious what causes it to work with some combination of plugin dependencies and not others. It is typically the presence of one culprit plugin that if removed from the project, allows everything to work again.\r\n\r\nIn almost every case, it is extremely difficult to track down which plugin is causing plugin registration to fail except by removing plugins one by one until things work again. Perhaps this is also cause to try to improve the error messages so that the real source of the problem can be more easily pinpointed."

This class is useful, for example, when unlimited width is available and you would like a child that would otherwise attempt to expand infinitely to instead size itself to a more reasonable width.\r\n\r\nIt seems like, much like `RenderFlex`, `RenderIntrinsicWidth` could honor its constraints while allowing its child to be smaller than the parent (`RenderIntrinsicWidth`).\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the following Render Tree:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRenderView\r\n│ configuration: Size(800, 600) at 1.0x (in logical pixels)\r\n│ size: Size(800, 600)\r\n└ RenderIntrinsicWidth\r\n  │ constraints: BoxConstraints(w=800, h=600)\r\n  │ size: Size(800, 600)\r\n  └ RenderConstrainedBox\r\n    │ constraints: BoxConstraints(w=800, h=600)\r\n    │ additionalConstraints: BoxConstraints(w=200, h=200)\r\n    │ size: Size(800, 600)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, the `RenderIntrinsicWidth` needs to be 800x600 because it received tight constraints by its parent `RenderView`.  However, it should relax those constraints that it passes to the child when it asks for the child's max intrinsic width to be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nchildConstraints: BoxConstraints(0.0<=w<=800.0, h=600.0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would yield the following tree, which would be truer to the documented behavior of the render object:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRenderView\r\n│ configuration: Size(800, 600) at 1.0x (in logical pixels)\r\n│ size: Size(800, 600)\r\n└ RenderIntrinsicWidth\r\n  │ constraints: BoxConstraints(w=800, h=600)\r\n  │ size: Size(800, 600)\r\n  └ RenderConstrainedBox\r\n    │ constraints: BoxConstraints(w=200, h=600) // because they're tightened to the child's intrinsic width\r\n    │ additionalConstraints: BoxConstraints(w=200, h=200)\r\n    │ size: Size(200, 600)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nAll of the above also applies to `RenderIntrinsicHeight`"

But there is still some accessibility focus edge cases that I can't find satisfying workarounds for, like these ones:\r\n\r\n - When a modal is closed, the focus normally return to the button that opens it, whatever I do, the accessibility focus return to the first element of the screen;\r\n - When an option is selected in a dropdown, the focus should return on the dropdown field itself, but again, the focus return to the first element of the screen;\r\n - When a save button from a form is clicked but there is still errors in it, the focus should go on the first field with error. The best I have done is to manage focus with requestFocus() and ensure it's visibility when focused with a scroll animation, but the accessibility focus just go on the element in the middle of the screen and I'm not sure why;\r\n<!--\r\n     Please tell us the problem you are running into that led to you wanting\r\n     a new feature.\r\n\r\n     Is your feature request related to a problem?

    "text": "The same Widget instance can be added multiple times (see https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Widget-class.html) so a Flutter app's widget hierarchy is actually a directed acyclic graph (DAG) instead of a tree. That is: the same Widget node could have multiple incoming edges as well as outgoing edges where an edge is a parent-child relationship. (The acyclic part comes from the fact that a widget is final and immutable so there's a topological order defined by the order of widget constructions, and therefore edges can't form a loop.)\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that we extensively use the term \"Widget tree\" in our docs, articles, slides, and tool descriptions (me included). See https://flutter.dev/docs/testing/code-debugging#widget-tree for an example.\r\n\r\nAfter checking the source code, I find that \"Widget tree dump\" is actually calling [debugDumpApp][] which dumps the Element tree. (The Elements do form a tree as the same Widget at different locations will instantiate different Elements. See https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Element-class.html.)\r\n\r\nThis also happens in `flutter run` tool where `?` prints out `w Dump widget hierarchy to the console`. The `w` actually calls [debugDumpApp][] to print out the element tree instead of the widget DAG.\r\n\r\nI wonder if we should clarify this so people get less confused, and are aware that they can reuse the same Widget instance multiple times in the hierarchy (which might be good for performance). Or is the Element so close to the Widget that it's Ok to just use the Widget tree to reference the Element tree?\r\n\r\n[debugDumpApp]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/28138ec5e3271ae35295a46bf2eeaf554eeb2535/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/binding.dart#L977"

If the home page is an empty UIViewController, i.e., all the flutter environment is not launched.\r\nXcode reports about 45MB memory usage, let's call it a homepage baseline.\r\nb. If the home page return a Text widget instead of it's designed business logic, xcode reports about 125MB memory usage. In other words, we can say that flutter engine and simplest flutter business logic brings about 80MB memory increment.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/817851/80560404-62833880-8a13-11ea-8d20-8e67970819be.png)\r\nThis data(80MB) also matches the flutter_gallery one where I forced to return a Text widget.\r\nc. When I removed test code to allow HomePage return what it's designed, the memory increases a lot. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/817851/80559728-19ca8000-8a11-11ea-9161-fce7f618a75e.png)\r\nThe xcode reports about 90MB of memory increment while Observatory reports only 30MB of memory increment. I think it is probably resulted from flutter related code, however, the observatory make me pretty confusing.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel stable/v1.12.13+hotfix.8, v1.12.13+hotfix.8, on Mac OS X 10.15.4 19E287, locale en-CN)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.12.13+hotfix.8 at /Users/kylewong/Codes/Flutter/alibaba-flutter/StableV1.12.13/official/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision 0b8abb4724 (3 months ago), 2020-02-11 11:44:36 -0800\r\n    • Engine revision e1e6ced81d\r\n    • Dart version 2.7.0\r\n\r\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.2)\r\n    • Android SDK at /Users/kylewong/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Android NDK location not configured (optional; useful for native profiling support)\r\n    • Platform android-R, build-tools 29.0.2\r\n    • Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_212-release-1586-b4-5784211)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[!] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS (Xcode 11.3.1)\r\n    • Xcode at /Applications/Xcode11.3.1.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    • Xcode 11.3.1, Build version 11C505\r\n    !

    "text": "## Background\r\n\r\n[The characters package](https://pub.dev/packages/characters) was recently introduced to address Dart String's limitations of manipulating extended grapheme clusters (https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/34). However, our user study shows that it is often difficult for developers to identify use cases where the characters package should be used instead of the Dart String API. \r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nAs part of a larger plan to help developers make better API choices for text manipulation tasks, it would be helpful to suggest the characters package in the documentation of APIs that expect the developer to process text that might include extended grapheme clusters. Providing sample code that have `characters` included would be especially useful since no everyone reads the doc carefully.\r\n\r\nBuilding on the [Character Library's Impact Beyonds Text Related Widgets.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18SxWeHpds4modnvo997vIOiq01EspeFgsNvPa5ey88w/edit#) doc, I suggest the following changes:\r\n\r\n### TextField-related\r\n- [ ] Use `characters` in the [reading values sample code](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextField-class.html#reading-values) for the `TextField` class.\r\n- [ ] Use `characters` in [the sample code](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextField/onChanged.html) for the `onChange` property of the `TextField` class.\r\n- [ ] Add sample code to the [API doc of TextInputFormatter](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/TextInputFormatter-class.html) and use `characters` in the sample. \r\n\r\n### showSearch\r\n\r\n- [ ] Recommend developers use `characters` in the documentation of [showSearch](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/showSearch.html) or [SearchDelegate](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SearchDelegate-class.html) and provide a sample.\r\n\r\n### CircleAvatar\r\n- [ ] In the [Flutter Gallery demo of CircleAvatar](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/dev/integration_tests/flutter_gallery/lib/demo/material/tabs_demo.dart), use `characters` to access the first character in a string.\r\n\r\n###  Navigator\r\n- [ ] Provide some guidance on parsing route names that might include extended grapheme clusters. More context in [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18SxWeHpds4modnvo997vIOiq01EspeFgsNvPa5ey88w/edit#heading=h.9w7ovhhbaioc).\r\n\r\nFeel free to create sub-issues to make this more manageable. This issue is currently blocked by https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/53381 and https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/55593.\r\n\r\nCc: @chunhtai "

    "text": "I have built a video calling app in Flutter using the Agora SDK. This is only available for iOS/Android and so for the web build I had to build a wrapper around the existing Agora web SDK. Due to the way Flutter renders web elements inside a shadow DOM, you cannot access elements by document.getElementById(), which is what the Agora SDK uses to inject their video player. To get around this I am rendering an IFrame that has the div and Agora SDK script bundled together.\r\n\r\nIt is all working nicely but when any event is triggered inside the browser window, such as the mouse entering a button or clicking anything, the IFrame refreshes and rebuilds the video view which takes 1-2 seconds to initialize.\r\n\r\nIs there anyway I can unlink the IFrame from the browser events? I tried marking the HtmlElementView as const and putting it inside a StatefulWidget that only registers the platform view once. The widget isn't actually running the build() method again but the IFrame still refreshes.\r\n\r\nFlutter Code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nui.platformViewRegistry.registerViewFactory(\r\n        'video-container',\r\n            (int viewId) => IFrameElement()\r\n          ..id = 'my-iframe'\r\n          ..width = '100%'\r\n          ..height = '100%'\r\n          ..src = 'assets/web_elements/agora_container.html'\r\n          ..allow = \"camera; microphone\"\r\n          ..style.border = 'none');\r\n\r\n@override\r\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n    print(\"*****\\n\\n\\nBuilding the web host container\\n\\n\\n*****\"); // this is only printing once\r\n    return const HtmlElementView(\r\n      viewType: 'video-container',\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgora Code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div id=\"local-video\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"remote-video\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"video-canvas\"></div>\r\n\r\n<script src=\"scripts/AgoraSDK.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"scripts/agora_controller.js\"></script>\r\n```"

    "text": "While installing google_maps_flutter plug-in, it's required to enable embedded view on iOS side. According to the instructions on [pub.dev page of google_maps_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter#-readme-tab-), one needs to add the key `io.flutter.embedded_views_preview` into Info.plist file with the value `YES`. As a developer with Android Development background, I find this a bit confusing. The statement does not specify the type of value which in this case is ´YES´. On the other hand, I've seen people using value `<true/>`. This usage can be found in the  **[Adding Google Maps to a Flutter App](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/google-maps-in-flutter/#0)** codelab as well. I've successfully added google_maps_flutter plugin to my app by using `<true/>`. Which way to do this is the right one? Am I missing something related to Info.plist file and the way it works?"

I could imagine putting the selected view and the point into one ViewGroup and having the Point overlay the View. Did someone have experience with this problem?

For instance, this happens with the Reflectly story day widgets. As the animation is usally easing out (i.e. its near-final animation state is almost still), this can lead to certain micro-issues like the user having to click twice to open something without properly understanding why; one can also not navigate the app as intuitively fast as one wants to, but always has to wait for the animation to settle in.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my question is, is this a native issue with Flutter, or perhaps something not native but easy to run into given common Flutter coding patterns?

    "text": "Hello,\r\n\r\n  I had one native plugin working without problems.\r\n  I upgraded Flutter and Android (kotlin) and notice I had some serious error (crash the app)\r\n\r\n  I could solve the problem, but with a \"not cool solution\". I search around and see some people in stack overflow with same problem as well in the end of January.\r\n\r\n  The problem is with this method: onAttachedToActivity()\r\n  When this method is called, by the Wiki (https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Experimental:-Create-Flutter-Plugin) it says:\r\n   \r\n> \"If you are creating channels in your onAttachToEngine(), there is no need to cleanup those creations in onDetachFromEngine() and creating them again the second time onAttachToEngine() is called is fine.\"\r\n\r\n  So, first, the problem explanation I could investigate:\r\n\r\nThe code:\r\n```kotlin\r\n  override fun onAttachedToActivity(binding: ActivityPluginBinding) {\r\n    Log.v(\"PLUGIN\", \"[ onAttachedToActivity ]\")\r\n    Log.v(\"PLUGIN\", \"  Binding: $binding\")\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output:\r\n```\r\nI/flutter: Observatory listening on http://127.0.0.1:36799/C30Q3sI3Mho=/\r\nD/FlutterActivityAndFragmentDelegate: Attaching FlutterEngine to the Activity that owns this Fragment.\r\nV/PLUGIN: [ onAttachedToActivity ]\r\nV/PLUGIN:   Binding: io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEnginePluginRegistry$FlutterEngineActivityPluginBinding@2593b8c\r\nV/PLUGIN: [ onAttachedToActivity ]\r\nV/PLUGIN:   Binding: io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEnginePluginRegistry$FlutterEngineActivityPluginBinding@2593b8c\r\nD/FlutterView: Attaching to a FlutterEngine: io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine@d689fbc\r\n```\r\n\r\n  As you can see, the app calls 2 times the onAttachedToActivity.\r\n  I have one class that is created there ```MethodCallHandlerImpl```. Then I will end up with 2 instances of it.\r\n  When I use the ```binding.addRequestPermissionsResultListener(this)``` in this class to I got notification when the user accepts/denies the calendar read access, I end up with 2 calls for ```override fun onRequestPermissionsResult( ... )```, but only one of the instances receive the Dart/Platform code from ```override fun onMethodCall( ... )```\r\n\r\nI made a little debug to check all the information above.\r\nIf I get the ```MethodChannel.Result``` as private variable member of the class when the ```onMethodCall``` is called, I will have two calls for ```onRequestPermissionsResult```. One of this calls is being from ```onMethodCall```, so the ```MethodChannel.Result``` is initialized. The other call is from the instance that the method ```onMethodCall``` was **not** called ! Then the ``MethodChannel.Result``` does not exists, was not initialized and the app will crash.\r\n\r\n\r\n**The solutions**\r\n\r\nSolution 1:\r\nI solved this error with an inline callback in ```onMethodCall``` that will use the ```MethodChannel.Result``` from the method parameters. But I still will have 2 ```override fun onRequestPermissionsResult( ... )``` calls.\r\n\r\nSolution 2:\r\nAnother solution is, when ```onAttachedToActivity``` be called, I can remove the binding listener to just use one ```MethodCallHandlerImpl``` and destroy the old, but I don't know the complications of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Comments**\r\nI think the right lifecycle would be attach and detach, but maybe it's attaching twice because some new internal Flutter lifecycle with Android Views/Activity\r\n\r\nI can provide an empty plugin example with the error and the solution if needed, but only can send it in Monday (10 Feb).\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

Then I wait until the method is finished before guiding the user to the next screen.\r\n\r\nEvery code works fine, i can load the product information i can make purchases and get informed via email about the purchase. But the lines\r\n```dart\r\nQueryPurchaseDetailsResponse purchaseResponse =\r\n        await _connection.queryPastPurchases();\r\n```\r\nalways return an empty list of past purchases.\r\n\r\nWhat i do : \r\n1. Start the app\r\n2. Buy the non consumable\r\n3. Close the app\r\n4. Start the app\r\n5. Check for past purchase\r\n\r\nBackground information : \r\n- The app runs in debug mode\r\n- The app runs on a normal device \r\n- I use a real playstore user for the purchase\r\n\r\nAny idea whats wrong ?\r\n\r\nRegards"

I made a new flutter_web project by (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web)\r\n2. I created `Assets` folder at the project root and added it to the `pubspec.yaml` too.\r\n(`flutter pub get` also been done.)\r\n3. I used `asset.image` widget with the url of the image like this.\r\n`Image.asset (\"assets/images/logo.png\"),`\r\n\r\n**Expected results:** <!-- what did you want to see? -->\r\nLike mobile does, I expect to show my logo image to the screen, but it doesn't.\r\n\r\nFollowing #43966, I changed my code from `Image.asset` to `Image.network` and moved asset folder into the `www` folder. Then, it works perfectly.\r\n\r\nWhy flutter web doesn't allow using `Images.asset` to add image like?\r\n\r\n\r\n**Actual results:** <!-- what did you see? -->\r\nWhen I use `Asset.Image`, flutter compiler printed this log : \r\n```\r\nError while trying to load an asset: Failed to load asset at \"assets/images/domain.png\" (404)\r\n══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY IMAGE RESOURCE SERVICE ╞══════\r\nThe following assertion was thrown resolving an image codec:\r\nUnable to load asset: assets/images/domain.png\r\n```\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Logs</summary>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n      Run your application with `flutter run --verbose` and attach all the\r\n      log output below between the lines with the backticks.

I made my plugin implement both `ActivityAware` and `ServiceAware` but only the lifecycle methods of the former were actually called. I also passed in my `Service` instance as the constructor argument when creating the background `FlutterEngine` but this itself didn't cause the `ServiceAware` callbacks to be called.\r\n> \r\n> In any event, I got my plugin working with v2 using a different approach.\r\n> \r\n> As some constructive feedback, I do appreciate all the hard work the Flutter team is doing, BUT I also hope that this migration experience is not something I will ever have to go through again.

    "text": "## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct but related breakages here: double registration and too early registration when automatic registration is relied on. I'm going to describe them both below.\r\n\r\n### Double registration\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n1. Run `flutter create -t app` with flutter stable (v.12.13)\r\n2. Include any plugin using the v1 embedding that doesn't require an activity (for example, `firebase_messaging`)\r\n3. `flutter run` on an Android device.\r\n\r\n**Expected results:** Plugin should be registered and function normally.\r\n\r\n**Actual results:** The plugin is registered twice (visible with a debugger), leading to plugin-specific bugs caused by multiple instances of the same plugin class responding to single MethodChannel calls. For example, see https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire/issues/1669: a particular plugin method is always called twice.\r\n\r\n### Early registration\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n1. Run `flutter create -t app` with flutter stable (v1.12.13)\r\n2. Remove the template `MainActivity` in favor of `FlutterActivity` [as recommended by our official migration docs](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/plugin-api-migration).\r\n3. Include any plugin using the v1 embedding that requires an activity (for example, `google_maps_flutter`).\r\n4. `flutter run` on an Android device.\r\n\r\n**Expected results:** Plugin should be registered and function normally.\r\n\r\n**Actual results:** The plugin is registered before the activity is set on the shim registrar (visible with a debugger), leading to plugin-specific bugs caused by the null activity. For example, see flutter/flutter#47921: the plugin appears to never be registered and is completely unusable.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nAutomatic plugin registration was proposed [in this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xNkBmcdVL1yEXqtZ65KzTwfr5UXDD05VVKYXIXGX7p8/edit#) and merged in flutter/engine#13455. The goal stated in the doc is to remove boilerplate code in user apps, but I think it may also have been to support background registration. (@bkonyi @matthew-carroll to confirm)\r\n\r\nThe v1 registration flow expected plugins to be registered once, and the registration call to contain any information the plugin may need (like an `Activity`). The v2 registration flow in contrast is done over a series of lifecycle callbacks and never propagates all the necessary information for a plugin at a single call. The v2 registration flow is supposed to still be compatible with v1-only plugins through a `ShimPluginRegistry`, which internally listens to all the v2 callbacks.\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\n_Edited 1/27/2020_: This has been fixed in the framework as of flutter/flutter@4fbb85e0c207132e0ed9130d7410784c00f0d066, but still hasn't rolled to any channels or versions other than master. \r\n\r\n## Suggested fix\r\n\r\nWe disable the current automatic registration call in `FlutterEngine` when it's constructed via `FlutterActivity` and add an automatic registration call into the `configureFlutterEngine` of the `FlutterActivity` superclass. That way it will get called at the appropriate time in both the foreground and background case automatically and will still be under Flutter source code instead of user code. As a bonus the generated template doesn't call `super()` so this should automatically fix the problem in existing user apps without the need for a migration. The \"ugly\" part here is that from now on we're going to expect users to call `super()` when they override `configureFlutterEngine` if they're not registering plugins themselves, and it's been a no-op before. So people who have been deliberately overriding it will be impacted. I'm unaware of any such cases today.\r\n\r\n_Edit: The purpose is to avoid having critical code in a user template, not just removing boilerplate. This is a stronger case to avoid reverting._ ~~**If** the automatic registration was only to remove boilerplate code, I suggest we revert that change and change all our official docs to recommend registering plugins in a subclass of `FlutterActivity`, like the template. Knowing the \"right\" place to correctly automatically register v1 plugins with the v2 embedding so that they have all their required state is difficult since the embedding can be completely decoupled from any kind of activity or service at all. The boilerplate is regrettable but preferable to bugs.~~\r\n\r\n_Edit: This won't work for all background cases, figured out in an offline discussion._ ~~Assuming the automatic registration is necessary to support background cases better, @amirh suggested a plan where at a high level we can basically avoid this problem by still automatically registering eventually, but delaying the automatic registration until the plugin registry is either attached to an activity (for foreground cases) or a service (for background cases). Then we should change the tool's template and urge users to migrate away from the currently `MainActivity` registration call.~~ \r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- flutter/flutter#47921\r\n- flutter/flutter#49346\r\n- FirebaseExtended/flutterfire#1669\r\n\r\n/cc @amirh @bkonyi @matthew-carroll @xster @blasten @workerbee22 @woprandi "

My project structure looks like this:\r\n```\r\nlib/\r\n- main.dart\r\nweb/\r\n  - wasm_demo/\r\n     - src/\r\n       - lib.rs\r\n     - pkg/\r\n       - wasm_demo.js\r\n       - wasm_demo_bg.wasm\r\n     - bootstrap.js\r\n     - Cargo.toml\r\n  - index.html\r\n```\r\nThe Rust code just creates a `String` and returns it:\r\n```rust\r\n// web/wasm_demo/src/lib.rs\r\n\r\nuse wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;\r\n\r\n#[wasm_bindgen]\r\npub fn get_string() -> String {\r\n    String::from(\"This is a Rust String!\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen compiled with `wasm-pack build` the bytecode ends up in `web/wasm_demo/pkg/wasm_demo_bg.wasm`. `wasm_demo.js` is just a JavaScript module exporting the `get_string` function from `wasm_demo_bg.wasm`:\r\n```js\r\nimport * as wasm from './wasm_demo_bg.wasm';\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n/**\r\n* @returns {string}\r\n*/\r\nexport function get_string() {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`bootstrap.js` imports that module and puts it into the `window` object:\r\n```js\r\n// bootstrap.js\r\n\r\nimport * as wasm_demo from \"./pkg/wasm_demo\";\r\n\r\nwindow.wasm_demo = wasm_demo;\r\n```\r\n`index.html` loads that bootstrapper prior to launching the actual application:\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n<head>\r\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\r\n  <title>Rust/WASM/Flutter interop demo</title>\r\n</head>\r\n\r\n<body>\r\n  <script src=\"wasm_demo/bootstrap.js\" type=\"module\"></script>\r\n\r\n  <script src=\"main.dart.js\" type=\"application/javascript\"></script>\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\nAnd finally, Flutter displays the Rust `String`:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nimport 'dart:js';\r\n\r\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\r\n\r\nvoid main() {\r\n  runApp(MyApp());\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\r\n  @override\r\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n    return MaterialApp(\r\n      title: 'Rust/WASM/Flutter interop demo',\r\n      theme: ThemeData(\r\n        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,\r\n      ),\r\n      home: MyHomePage(),\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {\r\n  @override\r\n  Widget build(BuildContext buildContext) {\r\n    var rustString = context[\"wasm_demo\"].callMethod('get_string').toString();\r\n\r\n    return Scaffold(\r\n      appBar: AppBar(\r\n        title: Text(\"Rust/WASM/Flutter interop demo\"),\r\n      ),\r\n      body: Center(\r\n        child: Text(rustString),\r\n      ),\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem I have is that `wasm_demo_bg.wasm` is apparently not included in the bundle:\r\n```bash\r\n:44809/wasm_demo/pkg/wasm_demo:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)\r\n```\r\nIs there any way to tell Flutter that the WebAssembly module is needed in the bundle? Thanks!\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Clone this: https://github.com/malte-v/flutter-rust-interop\r\n2. flutter run -d chrome\r\n3.

For intersectsWithSphere, I think line 57 could be changed to:\r\n\r\n`final double s = l.dot(_direction.normalized());`\r\n\r\nAnd for at, line 40 could be:\r\n\r\n`Vector3 at(double t) => _direction.normalized().scale(t)..add(_origin);`\r\n\r\nDoes this sound like a good plan?\r\n\r\n(Ps. just looking through the file, looks like generally the direction vector might need normalising before use eg. in copyAt.

As Firebase Auth uses a `Future` and we can't `await` inside `initState` I used `then`, which updates the `text` in a later time:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n@override\r\n  void initState() {\r\n    super.initState();\r\n    _auth = Provider.of<FirebaseAuth>(context, listen: false);\r\n    _crashlytics = Provider.of<Crashlytics>(context, listen: false);\r\n\r\n    _auth.currentUser().then((user) {\r\n      _textController.value = TextEditingValue(\r\n        text: user.email ?? '',\r\n        selection: TextSelection(\r\n          baseOffset: user.email?.length ?? 0,\r\n          extentOffset: user.email?.length ?? 0,\r\n        ),\r\n        composing: TextRange.empty,\r\n      );\r\n      _isEmailValid = isEmailValid(user.email);\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs soon as I update the `TextEditingController.value` my `TextField.onChanged` callback executes.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but in my Android Pixel 2 AVD the callback is first called with an empty `String` then the actual email `String` and then a third time with an empty `String` again, **leaving a blank `TextField`**, defeating the purpose of all of this code. This doesn't happen on my phone, but I believe it's because my phone executes the Firebase Auth `Future` a lot quicker. I tried to simulate this with a `Future.value()` and `Future.delayed()` but couldn't reproduce it.\r\n\r\nIn any case, either the docs should be updated with the current behavior or the behavior should be fixed to match the docs.\r\n"

For e.g.\r\n\r\nI can depend on a specific package named `xyz` by keeping it along with its dependecies in a folder say `packages` alongside the `lib` folder as shown below.\r\n\r\n```\r\nproject\r\n |_ lib\r\n |_ packages\r\n   |_ xyz\r\n   |_ dep1_for_xyz\r\n   |_ dep2_for_xyz\r\n```\r\nThen referring to it in `pubspec.yaml` as shown below and this works.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndependencies:\r\n  flutter:\r\n    sdk: flutter\r\n\r\n  xyz:\r\n    path: packages/xyz\r\n```\r\nBut this seems very in efficient and dirty solution especially to keep all transitive dependencies along with the main dependencies. \r\n\r\n**Problems & question:**\r\nI came across this environment variable `pub_hosted_url` in the following pages: [ref1][1] and [ref2][2].\r\n\r\nI tried to use it as follows.\r\n\r\n 1. Create an environment variable `pub_hosted_url` and point it to a directory in the remote svn repo.\r\n    - for e.g., `https://username:password@repository_url/dart_packages`.\r\n 2. Then add & commit a package inside this `dart_packages` folder.\r\n    - for e.g. `built_value_generator-6.8.2` and all its relevant dependencies in a similar fashion.\r\n 3. Then add the dependencies in the `pubspec.yaml` as usual.\r\n    - for e.g `built_value_generator: ^6.7.1`\r\n 4. Then run the `flutter pub get -v`.\r\n\r\n\r\n***Problem1**:*\r\nI am currently facing an Handshake error on client side. I understand this because of the certificate that svn server uses. Since its a self signed certificate,  flutter/pub/dart is unable to verify the validity of this certificate. \r\n\r\nfollowing is the error I see.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ +528 ms] IO  : Retry #1 for GET https://pub_hosted_url/api/packages/built_value_generator...\r\n[   +3 ms] IO  : HTTP GET https://pub_hosted_url/api/packages/built_value_generator\r\n[   +2 ms]     | Accept: application/vnd.pub.v2+json\r\n[   +2 ms]     | user-agent: Dart pub 2.7.0\r\n[  +24 ms] IO  : HTTP error:\r\n[   +2 ms]     | HandshakeException: Handshake error in client (OS Error:\r\n[   +2 ms]     |        CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED: self signed certificate in certificate chain(handshake.cc:354))\r\n[   +1 ms]     |\r\n[   +1 ms]     | dart:_http                                         _HttpClient.openUrl\r\n[   +2 ms]     | package:http/src/io_client.dart 33:36              IOClient.send\r\n[        ]     | package:pub/src/http.dart 68:39                    _PubHttpClient.send\r\n[        ]     | package:http_retry/http_retry.dart 97:33           RetryClient.send\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n***Question1***\r\nHow do I let `flutter pub get` know that this is a trusted host or even add this certificate into its trusted list.\r\n\r\n***A working Solution in my case*** \r\nThis is based on this [comment](https://github.com/flutter/website/issues/2472#issuecomment-440462890).\r\n\r\n1. First export the certificate using a broswer(Chrome in my case) and save it a local path e.g. desktop.\r\n    - This usually would be with a `.cer` extension.\r\n2. Then using `openssl` convert the `.cer` file into `.pem` file.\r\n    - Using the command as shown [here](https://serverfault.com/questions/254627/how-do-i-convert-a-cer-certificate-to-pem).\r\n3. Create an environment variable `DART_VM_OPTIONS` and set its value to  `--root-certs-file=<path_to_pem_file>`\r\n4. Then running flutter packages get resolves the URL and initiates a correct connection.\r\n\r\nIs this a correct solution.? A reference or guide could help. With some review help I will try to write a wiki page for this in the respective issue [here][4].\r\n\r\n***Problem 2:***\r\nThis problem I see is from the above error message, where the packages are looked with the following url format `https://pub_hosted_url/api/packages/my_dependency`. This means the `flutter pub get` expects packages to be placed in a very specific format or specific location. I couldn't find any relevant documentation for this apart from this alpha level `pub_server` package [here][3]. \r\n\r\n***Question 2***\r\nSo question is What is the correct format of hosting our packages internally in an svn repo, if at all if its possible.\r\n\r\n***Part of the error I see as of now***\r\n```\r\n[  +18 ms] IO  : Get versions from https://pub_hosted_url//api/packages/cupertino_icons.\r\n[  +24 ms] IO  : HTTP GET https://pub_hosted_url//api/packages/cupertino_icons\r\n[        ]     | Accept: application/vnd.pub.v2+json\r\n[        ]     | user-agent: Dart pub 2.7.0\r\n[ +277 ms] IO  : HTTP response 200 OK for GET https://pub_hosted_url/api/packages/cupertino_icons\r\n[        ]     | took 0:00:00.278857\r\n[        ]     | last-modified: Thu, 12 Dec 2019 15:11:54 GMT\r\n[        ]     | cache-control: max-age=0\r\n[        ]     | date: Thu, 12 Dec 2019 15:35:09 GMT\r\n[        ]     | strict-transport-security: max-age=7884000; includeSubdomains;\r\n[        ]     | content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\n[        ]     | x-xss-protection: 1\r\n[        ]     | server: Apache\r\n[        ]     | ctfusername: someusername\r\n[        ]     | accept-ranges: bytes\r\n[        ]     | content-length: 610\r\n[        ]     | x-ua-compatible: IE=Edge\r\n[        ]     | etag: W/\"478//dart_packages/api/packages/cupertino_icons\"\r\n[        ]     | expires: Thu, 12 Dec 2019 15:35:09 GMT\r\n[   +9 ms] SLVR: Version solving took 0:00:00.383291 seconds.\r\n[   +2 ms]     | Tried 1 solutions.\r\n[        ] FINE: Resolving dependencies finished (0.390s).\r\n[   +3 ms] ERR : Unexpected character (at character 1)\r\n[   +6 ms]     | <html><head><title>file-releases - Revision 478: /dart_packages/api/package...\r\n[   +1 ms]     | ^\r\n[        ] FINE: Exception type: FormatException\r\n[  +15 ms] ERR : dart:convert                                jsonDecode\r\n[   +1 ms]     | package:pub/src/source/hosted.dart 166:15   BoundHostedSource.doGetVersions\r\n[   +3 ms]     | ===== asynchronous gap ===========================\r\n[   +1 ms]     | dart:async                                  Future.catchError\r\n[   +1 ms]     | package:pub/src/utils.dart 109:52           captureErrors.<fn>\r\n[   +1 ms]     | package:stack_trace                         Chain.capture\r\n[   +2 ms]     | package:pub/src/utils.dart 122:11           captureErrors\r\n[        ]     | package:pub/src/command_runner.dart 171:13  PubCommandRunner.runCommand\r\n[        ]     | dart:async                                  _completeOnAsyncReturn\r\n[        ]     | package:pub/src/command_runner.dart         PubCommandRunner._validatePlatform\r\n[   +1 ms]     | dart:async                                  _completeOnAsyncReturn\r\n[   +1 ms]     | package:pub/src/io.dart                     runProcess.<fn>\r\n````\r\nTo an extent its clear why this error occurs. I think this is some form of api request and hence the failure occurs. Its expecting some form of `json` response maybe. But how could this be resolved in a correct manner so that the dependencies are resolved appropriately. what is the correct approach without using any pub_server.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://dart.dev/tools/pub/dependencies#hosted-packages\r\n  [2]: https://dart.dev/tools/pub/environment-variables\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/dart-lang/pub_server\r\n  [4]: https://github.com/flutter/website/issues/2472"

    "text": "We have a flavored Flutter application. Each flavor has a different bundle ID from a different Apple account.\r\n\r\nThe code signing is setup correctly on the Xcode Build Configurations, I can archive and deploy all my applications without a problem, but i can only launch one flavor on an iOS device from either Android Studio or VS Code because there is a \"global\" iOS signing certificate set for the project. I.e., if the \"project certificate\" is set to the certificate of flavor \"A\", when I try to run the flavor \"B\" on an iOS Device directly from both IDEs it will try to sign the flavor \"B\" with the certificate of flavor \"A\" and the Xcode build will fail.\r\n\r\nThe only way I have to launch the apps on a real iOS device is to perform a `flutter build ios debug --flavor <flavor> -t <main-file.dart> --no-codesign` and then run the desired flavor directly from Xcode, but of course when doing that I have no debugging on the dart code.\r\nI use this flow of performing two builds when archiving and distributing the applications and it works as expected, the only problem I face is with the debug.\r\n\r\nSince this issue is related only to code signing, the flavors also works as expected on the iOS Simulator, I can launch any flavor I want on debug on a simulator.\r\n\r\nI could use `flutter config --clear-ios-signing-cert` to change the cert, but of course this isn't the ideal solution because I would still be stuck to one flavor at a time.\r\n\r\nAm I doing any configuration wrong? Is there any way to configure flutter in order to get the code signing certificate for debug builds from the iOS configurations on Xcode instead of relying on the certificate set for the project?\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n\r\n1) I run the **alpha** flavor using `flutter run -t lib/alpha-main.dart --flavor alpha`\r\n2) It asked me to selected a development certificate from a list of available certificates and I selected the certificate for **alpha**.\r\n3) The certificate for **alpha** is now set as default.\r\n4) The app build and run on my device as expected.\r\n5) I now tries to run **beta** flavor using `flutter run -t lib/beta-main.dart --flavor beta`\r\n6) flutter run tries to sign **beta** app with the **alpha** signing certificate.\r\n7) The build fails.\r\n\r\n```\r\nflutter doctor -v\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, v1.9.1+hotfix.6, on Mac OS X 10.15.1 19B88, locale\r\n    pt-BR)\r\n    • Flutter version 1.9.1+hotfix.6 at /Users/edisonlsm/Library/flutter\r\n    • Framework revision 68587a0916 (3 months ago), 2019-09-13 19:46:58 -0700\r\n    • Engine revision b863200c37\r\n    • Dart version 2.5.0\r\n\r\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.2)\r\n    • Android SDK at /Users/edisonlsm/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    • Android NDK location not configured (optional; useful for native profiling\r\n      support)\r\n    • Platform android-29, build-tools 29.0.2\r\n    • Java binary at: /Applications/Android\r\n      Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build\r\n      1.8.0_202-release-1483-b49-5587405)\r\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\r\n\r\n[✓] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS (Xcode 11.1)\r\n    • Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\r\n    • Xcode 11.1, Build version 11A1027\r\n    • CocoaPods version 1.7.5\r\n\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 3.5)\r\n    • Android Studio at /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents\r\n    • Flutter plugin version 41.1.2\r\n    • Dart plugin version 191.8593\r\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build\r\n      1.8.0_202-release-1483-b49-5587405)\r\n\r\n[!] IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (version 2018.3.4)\r\n    • IntelliJ at /Applications/IntelliJ IDEA CE.app\r\n    ✗ Flutter plugin not installed; this adds Flutter specific functionality.\r\n    ✗ Dart plugin not installed; this adds Dart specific functionality.\r\n    • For information about installing plugins, see\r\n      https://flutter.dev/intellij-setup/#installing-the-plugins\r\n\r\n[✓] VS Code (version 1.40.2)\r\n    • VS Code at /Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents\r\n    • Flutter extension version 3.7.1\r\n\r\n[✓] Connected device (2 available)\r\n    • iPhone            • <id> • ios • iOS\r\n      13.2.3\r\n    • iPhone 11 Pro Max • <id>     • ios •\r\n      com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-13-1 (simulator)\r\n```\r\n"

So my theory is that the cause is due to a recent underlying change within flutter. \r\n\r\nOr if not a direct flutter issue, there needs to be some guidance to plugin developers about changes they need to make, so they can make sure they know how to make their plugins compatible with the latest beta or dev builds?

I read the provided documentation:\r\n* [FocusNode class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusNode-class.html)\r\n  * Contains a single example of how to create a widget that can focus/unfocus itself and change its behavior depending on its focus state.\r\n* [Focus class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Focus-class.html)\r\n  * Contains a partial example, which is an excerpt of the FocusNode example.\r\n* [FocusScope class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusScope-class.html)\r\n  * No examples\r\n* [FocusManager class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusManager-class.html)\r\n  * No examples.  Documentation explains briefly what it does, but makes no mention of how to use it for anything.\r\n* [FocusScopeNode class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusScopeNode-class.html)\r\n  * No examples.\r\n\r\nI found the provided documentation to be missing key information:\r\n1. How to use Focus and FocusScope to control focus in an application with multiple widgets.\r\n1. Examples of common use-cases:\r\n   * How to focus a widget in response to a tap.\r\n   * How to automatically focus a new widget.\r\n   * How to unfocus a widget.\r\n   * How to keep a widget focused.\r\n   * How to keep a focused widget visible.\r\n   * How to keep the keyboard on screen.\r\n   * How to determine when the keyboard is visible and update the display accordingly.\r\n   * How to move focus from one widget to the next in a form.\r\n   * How to specify the order of widget focus movement.\r\n   * How to provide expected software keyboard decorations to move from one widget to the next.\r\n   * How to dismiss the software keyboard on non-Android platforms.\r\n\r\nMy app requires all of these use-cases.  So far, I have made-do with reading Flutter's source code (a huge time sink), stackoverflow answers, and snippets shared in Flutter issues.  My implementations are unsatisfactory in many ways.  Today I have just wasted 2 hours trying to solve the problem of keeping the keyboard on screen on iOS, still with no solution.  Focus management is an area where I have sunk a lot of time working around missing parts of Flutter.  It has been and continues to be a struggle, a large energy sink.  I want to be building features and solving problems for my users, not fighting against the UX framework.\r\n\r\nI think better documentation would help me and other app developers to arrive at good solutions quickly.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nPlease allocate some time to writing some high-level documentation on managing keyboard focus in Flutter."

Just loop over the Implementers and find their sub-implementers.\r\n\r\nCurrently, it seems like some of these 2nd level implementers are described manually(human-generated) at the top of the class description in the api docs or as example code.\r\n"

I'm struggling to figure out how I check if a user's existing subscription has lapsed, which could be because of:\r\n- user has cancelled and the remaining time on the current billing period has elapsed\r\n- user has not auto-renewed and the remaining time on the current billing period has elapsed\r\n- payment error / in grace period\r\n\r\nIs this supported by the plugin, and if not are there any plans to? I'm struggling to figure out which functions I could use to implement periodic checks on ios and android. Here's what I've figured out so far:\r\n\r\nIOS:\r\n- documentation is on [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/handling_subscriptions_billing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/handling_subscriptions_billing)\r\n\r\n> Your app needs to determine which content the user has access to based on the period of time their auto-renewable subscription is active. To provide the customer access to the content to which they are entitled, keep a record of the date that each piece of content is published. Read the original_purchase_date, purchase_date, and expires_date field from each receipt entry to determine the start and end dates of each subscription period\r\n\r\nHow do you get the `expires_date` field from the ios receipt using in_app_purchase? The closest thing i could find is that `PurchaseDetails` has a `PurchaseWrapper` which contains a `purchaseTime` field - but the ios docs specifically say\r\n\r\n> Do not calculate the subscription period by adding a subscription duration to the purchase date. That approach fails to take into account the free trial period, the marketing opt-in period, and the content made available immediately after the user purchased the subscription.\r\n\r\nDoes in_app_purchase surface an `expires_date` or am I missing something?\r\n\r\nANDROID:\r\n- documentation [https://developer.android.com/google/play/developer-api.html#subscriptions_api_overview](https://developer.android.com/google/play/developer-api.html#subscriptions_api_overview)\r\n\r\nIt looks like we need to use Google Play Developer API to query a particular subscription to determine if it's still valid. To do this you need:\r\n\r\n> app package name, purchase or subscription ID, and the purchase token\r\n\r\nHow do you get the `purchaseToken` for Android? It looks like `PurchaseWrapper` contains this field, but the docs say `PurchaseWrapper` is null on Android:\r\n\r\n```\r\n /// Points back to the `BillingClient`'s [PurchaseWrapper] object that generated this [PurchaseDetails] object.\r\n  ///\r\n  /// This is null on Android.\r\n  final PurchaseWrapper billingClientPurchase;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm totally stuck. I don't see how this plugin can be used for subscriptions if you can't detect lapsed subscriptions. Any advice highly appreciated :)"

I'm getting ip address of the websocket server from the user in the first page and pass it to the second page which I will connnect to the websocket server and run the Sensors listener and calling setState in every change that happens in sensors.\r\nThe problem is, whenever I call Navigator.pop(context) (or just close the route) the listener is still giving data and calls my listener callback even though the route is disposed from the widget tree. I tried to call setState() when ever the widget is mounted by adding an if(this.mounted) and it fixed the setState calling when the widget is disposed, but when I added a print statement to the listener I realized that the listener is still calling my callback and it's not closed.\r\n\r\nMy question is haw can I close the Stream (more specificly the sensors listener) when I dispose a widget or destroy the route ?\r\nI appreciated any help or suggestion from you.\r\nThanks"

Create a shared preference key and value inside a old classic android app\r\n2. install a new flutter app with the same package name and a higher version code on top of the old app\r\n3. list all keys with the shared preferences plugin\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n     Please tell us which target platform(s) the problem occurs (Android / iOS / Web / macOS / Linux / Windows)\r\n     Which target OS version, for Web, browser, is the test system running?\r\n     Does the problem occur on emulator/simulator as well as on physical devices?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Target Platform:** Android\r\n**Devices:** Android Phone"

So, the goal is that Scaffold resizes automatically when the keyboard appears (MediaQuery viewInsets changes). This works correctly when the FlutterViewController fits the screen but when I give it a bottom padding the Scaffold still resizes without considering the \"correct\" area hidden by the keyboard which is now less than the normal scenario.\r\n\r\nIs this behaviour intended ? Any suggestion ?\r\n\r\nBR,\r\n"

Not modifying the global `Intl.defaultLocale` solved this issue. Meaning implementing the changes recommended in [this PR](https://github.com/flutter/website/pull/3013/files)\r\n\r\nNow I have another issue which causes the numbers and dates not to be formatted using the system locale (which it did before when i modified the the global `Intl.defaultLocale`).

    "text": "Platform views are massively expensive in terms on memory usage, loss of concurrency, battery usage, additional render target switches, etc.. Based on feedback seen from customers (for example, in this [internal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Vel2Nwy97Bc65yIiTpF-zevgArLqK8ISdgIQtV_igw/edit?ts=5d76b651#heading=h.r2i7gn60zi3s)), it is observed that customers may not be adequately aware of the negative performance implications of the addition of a platform views in their applications. While these impacts were known upfront, they are only documented at the lowest levels of the API at [`SceneBuilder::addPlatformView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/SceneBuilder/addPlatformView.html). Even the documentation at that level is easy to miss. Also, customers rarely use that API directly (instead platform views are wrapped in higher level widgets) and may miss the moment they step off a steep performance cliff.\r\n\r\nWhile the implementation of platform views continues to get better, the savings are minor compared to the baseline impact of the addition of a single platform view to the hierarchy. The well informed developer has the opportunity to make their applications significantly more performant and delightful for their users.\r\n\r\nA deeper discussion of the performance impact of the feature should include a discussion of the following issues:\r\n* The additional memory use.\r\n  * Discuss how the extra backing stores have be created.\r\n  * Discuss how large each backing store can get (screen size times buffer count which could be as high as 3 plus some additional fixed overhead).\r\n  * Discuss how the over is not constant and is function of the number of interleaving levels in the resultant view hierarchy.\r\n* The negative implications to concurrency (subject to platform specific restrictions).\r\n  * How a more restrictive thread configuration needs to be chosen (no GPU thread).\r\n  * How the frame pipeline depth needs to be reduced.\r\n  * The cost of switching thread configurations (barrier blocks and such).\r\n* De-optimizations in the renderer due to fewer retained layers from frame to frame.\r\n* De-optimization in the driver due to additional render target switches.\r\n  * Discuss how expensive a render target switch is relative to something the user can observe (say a backdrop filter).\r\n* The degradation in battery life.\r\n  * Discuss how Flutter has to perform more composition (that would otherwise have been avoided if there was no interleaving level).\r\n  * Discuss how the system compositor has to do more composition.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that these discussions are surfaces at multiple levels in the documentation. Including the following landing pages specifically identified:\r\n* The [PlatformViewLayer](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/PlatformViewLayer-class.html) class reference  and each memory of the same (for example the separate page for the constructor which comes up before everything else in search results).\r\n* The specific link for the [platform view layer](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/rendering-library.html) in the rendering library.\r\n* It is recommended that discussions about performance be highlighted somehow (maybe a red highlight to draw attention so it is hard to miss).\r\n* Highlight these platform view related discussions in the [Performance best practices](https://flutter.dev/docs/testing/best-practices) section. The omission of platform views from this section is alarming and we should address it ASAP. Especially since this feature has a more severe performance implication than everything currently on that page.\r\n* Highlight how to find and audit the use of platform views in the application in the section on [performance profiling](https://flutter.dev/docs/testing/ui-performance). Again, this section is not accurate today w.r.t the discussion on threading configuration when a platform view is in use.\r\n* In each of the sections on the main docs sites, a discussion of the performant alternatives to the use of platform views ought to be added.\r\n\r\nI suspect these discussions will need to be quickly and constantly updated as the some of the performance impacts are ameliorated. Platform views are really powerful and sometimes the only way to achieve some key piece of functionality in the application. But a more informed approach to their use can significantly improve application performance along multiple dimensions."

    "text": "In the [best-practies](https://flutter.dev/docs/testing/best-practices) it reads:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe traversal to rebuild all descendents stops when the same instance of the child widget as the previous frame is re-encountered.\r\n```\r\n\r\nPeople confuse \"same\" with \"equal\" vs \"identical\". So, the question raises whether Flutter is using the `operator==` or the `identical` function to determine when to stop rebuilding. Here is the code from `framework.dart`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  if (child.widget == newWidget) {\r\n    if (child.slot != newSlot)\r\n      updateSlotForChild(child, newSlot);\r\n    return child;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously, \"same instance\" in the docs is highly misleading and it should rather read \"equal instances\". Hence, two non-identical widgets with the same `runtime-type` and `key` that are equal with respect to `==` will stop rebuilding. That's an important aspect for performance optimisations.\r\n\r\nFor sure, the `operator==` defaults to identical in Dart, hence overriding `operator==` for a Widget is required to let the optimisation kick in.\r\n\r\nI think it would make sense to clarify that in the docs. (Replace \"same\" with \"equal\" and elaborate on the fact.)\r\n\r\nLink to Stackoverflow: \r\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57530086/does-overriding-operator-help-to-avoid-rebuilding"

    "text": "## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\na lots of flutter syntax error/compile error come out after we upgrade Flutter from 1.5.4 to 1.7.8, and all the root causes are breaking changes between the latest two stable versions.\r\n\r\nfor example\r\nin 1.5.4, we wrote codes like this\r\n```dart \r\n      ImageStream imageStream = imageProvider.resolve(configuration);\r\n      void listener(ImageInfo imageInfo, _) {\r\n        textImages[index] = imageInfo;\r\n        imageStream.removeListener(listener);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      imageStream.addListener(listener);\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut in 1.7.8, it can not work until we change it to the code below:\r\n\r\n```dart \r\n      ImageStream imageStream = imageProvider.resolve(configuration);\r\n      // we have to declare first，then assign in the second line，\r\n      // otherwise removeListener will report can't be referenced before it is declared.\r\n      ImageStreamListener listener;\r\n      listener = ImageStreamListener((ImageInfo imageInfo, bool synchronousCall) {\r\n        textImages[index] = imageInfo;\r\n        imageStream.removeListener(listener);\r\n      });\r\n      imageStream.addListener(listener);\r\n```\r\n\r\n **we have to declare listener first，then assign in the second line**. I don't think it is a regular way to write dart code.\r\n\r\nmore important, we have so much plugins that are using imageStream addListener/removeListener api. so we have to upgrade all the plugins before we run our top-level app code to avoid compile error, which is very annoying.\r\n\r\nFlutter team **Really Really Really** should consider introducing and using something like the Java's annotation @Deprecated(maybe exist already in dart, but it doesn't matter) to make the upgrade process more comfortable.\r\n\r\n"

    "text": "I was following the Firebase for Flutter Codelab and everything was great up through step 10.  Everything worked great.  Then Step 11 (the last actual coding step) has one seemingly minor change.  It is making the firebase call be wrapped in a transaction.\r\n\r\nAt first I typed the changes myself.  Then I hot reloaded and tried the application because no errors came up.  When I would tap on a baby name to upvote it nothing happened.  So I rechecked what I typed several times and still could not get it to work.  So then I tried copy and paste of only the code that was changed in Step 11.  Still did not work.\r\n\r\nLastly I tried a copy and paste of the whole main.dart file because Step 11 gives the whole main.dart file for reference as to what it should look like.  Even then it still does not work.  I tried doing a search but could not find anything.  So at this point I have absolutely no idea why my flutter app, that is \r\na copy and paste of the code from the actual codelab step 11, does not work.\r\n\r\nAny help would greatly be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks"

Everything works, but I'm getting a pretty huge margin at the bottom of the `NestedScrollView`. \r\n\r\nI believe it is caused by the `NestedScrollView` because wrapping a colored `Container` around it shows that the height is entirely it's own, not it's children.\r\n\r\nAttached below are some screenshot to help visualize my problem:\r\n\r\nHuge extra margin between widget and bottom of screen (Widget is centered)\r\n![device-2019-07-29-132746](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49853787/62022335-d2eff580-b206-11e9-935b-4a0523528298.png)\r\n\r\n`SingleChildScrollView` wraps height to content\r\n![device-2019-07-29-132803](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49853787/62022339-d5eae600-b206-11e9-871a-21934f05b8eb.png)\r\n\r\nAnd here is a snippet from my code (ignore override annotations as I cherry pick the relevant methods from child classes to make it more coherent):\r\n\r\n```\r\n @override\r\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n    return Scaffold(\r\n      body: StreamBuilder(\r\n          stream: bloc.dataStateStream,\r\n          initialData: DataLoadingState(),\r\n          builder: (context, snapshot) {\r\n            var state = snapshot.data;\r\n\r\n            if (state is DataLoadingState) {\r\n              bloc.loadData();\r\n              return _buildLoading();\r\n            } else {\r\n              return _buildDataLoaded();\r\n            }\r\n          }),\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n\r\n...........\r\n\r\nWidget _buildDataLoaded() {\r\n    return Container(\r\n      child: NestedScrollView(\r\n          headerSliverBuilder: (context, innerBoxIsScrolled) {\r\n            return [\r\n              SliverAppBar(\r\n                expandedHeight: 300,\r\n                flexibleSpace: FlexibleSpaceBar(\r\n                  background: buildHeader(),\r\n                ),\r\n                automaticallyImplyLeading: true,\r\n                pinned: false,\r\n                floating: false,\r\n                actions: buildOptionMenu(),\r\n              ),\r\n            ];\r\n          },\r\n          body: Center(\r\n            child: SingleChildScrollView(\r\n              child: Container(\r\n                child: Column(\r\n                  children: <Widget>[buildBody()],\r\n                ),\r\n              ),\r\n            ),\r\n          )\r\n      ),\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n@override\r\n  Widget buildBody() {\r\n    return Column(\r\n      children: <Widget>[_buildBio()],\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  Widget _buildBio() {\r\n    var dataContent = Column(\r\n      children: <Widget>[\r\n        _buildMetadata(),\r\n        _buildTitle(),\r\n        Text(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

    "text": "First of all, I have found several similar questions regarding my problem here and in Stackoverflow. I've spent the previous 16 hours implementing the answers, none of them worked. So this is my last resort hopefully someone can at least explain to me what is going on with my code.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nWhat I'm trying to do with my app is create a page with 3 forms. These forms are shown in order using a button click. For example the first form is shown at first the whole time, when the user clicks next, this form is **validated** and the next form appears in place of the previous one. So technically speaking, each form is set in its own separate file(i.e form1.dart ... etc) and the page is in its own file (i.e forms.dart). Each form has its own GlobalKey, these keys are used to validate the forms in the Forms class inside forms.dart inside the Next button click event.\r\n\r\nThis is a snippet of the code that actually works:\r\n\r\nHere is my main.dart content:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid main() {\r\n  runApp(MaterialApp(\r\n    debugShowCheckedModeBanner: true,\r\n    home: Forms(title: \"Forms\",\r\n      firstForm : new FirstForm(title: \"First Form\"),\r\n      secondForm : new SecondForm(title: \"First Form\"),\r\n      thirdForm : new ThirdForm(title: \"First Form\")),\r\n    routes: {\r\n      \"Entry\": (context) => DataScreen(title: 'Data screen',),\r\n    },\r\n  )\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is the Forms class:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Forms extends StatefulWidget {\r\n  Forms({Key key, this.title,this.firstForm,this.secondForm,this.thirdForm}) : super(key: key);\r\n  final String title;\r\n  static final _scafoldKey = new GlobalKey<ScaffoldState>();\r\n  final firstForm;\r\n  final

),\r\n        ],\r\n      )\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo what I'm doing, is instantiating the Forms class the firstForm, secondForm, thirdForm properties. These properties take objects of the forms respectively, these objects are then used to retrieve the forms keys using getters:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfinal GlobalKey<FormState>_formKey = new GlobalKey<FormState>();\r\n get formKey => _formKey;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Now, following this approach, everything works fine. The currentState of the GlobalKeys of each form is created. However, as you have noticed, I called the Forms class as the home of my App in the first code snippet, so once I remove it, and call it elsewhere. The currentState of each GlobalKey becomes null.**\r\n\r\nFor example, my App becomes this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid main() {\r\n  runApp(MaterialApp(\r\n    debugShowCheckedModeBanner: true,\r\n    home: HomePage(),\r\n    routes: {\r\n      \"Entry\": (context) => DataScreen(title: 'Data screen',),\r\n    },\r\n  )\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in the HomePage, I have a drawer with an item that takes me to the Forms page:\r\n\r\n```\r\nListTile(\r\n                title: new Text('Forms'),\r\n                onTap: () {\r\n                  Navigator.push(\r\n                    context,\r\n                    MaterialPageRoute(\r\n                      maintainState: true,\r\n                      builder: (context) => Forms(title: \"Forms\",\r\n                      firstForm : new FirstForm(title: \"First Form\"),\r\n                      secondForm : new SecondForm(title: \"First Form\"),\r\n                      thirdForm : new ThirdForm(title: \"First Form\"),\r\n                      ), \r\n                    ),\r\n                  );\r\n                },\r\n              ),\r\n```\r\n\r\n**This second approach produces the null error. However, something that is very very odd, is that when the first forms appears (on the first run ever), when I press Next without filling anything, the validate() method passes and the errors show on the screen telling me to fill the inputs. Once I fill them, I get that validate() was called on null, removing the values to attempt to see if it passes again, also produces null**\r\n"

    "text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have reviewed the criteria for scoring packages on pub.dev (https://pub.dev/help#scoring) and it looks like there is no requirement for automated tests to be included in popular packages.\r\n\r\nWould it be an idea to make some of the score depend on the coverage of automated tests included with a package?  Flutter's support for tests seems to be quite good to me, so we should encourage package maintainers to include a full test suite.\r\n\r\nAs part of the calculation of the score, this would probably include running the tests so I guess some kind of CI system would be needed that would add to the ongoing expense and complexity of pub.dev, but that could be a worthwhile gate for package maintainers as a final quality check before going live with a new release.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nPaul."

So basically my workflow follows this steps.\r\n1. On android side I am waiting for detection of sensor\r\n2. On detection i read it and invoke a method from Flutter\r\n3. Flutter generates a string based on argument, which he returns over method channel\r\n4. When i get the String back on Android side, I use that String and run other methods\r\n5. I send a variable on EventStream sink back to flutter\r\n6. Flutter listens to stream and displays the content\r\n\r\nAnd there are a couple of issues, your invoke method needs to run on MainThread, same goes for pushing variables on EventSink. **Is this a bug in the new version or you just want us to do with a single thread?** Second issue i found was even in the previous version, I simply don't know how and didn't find anything on the internet or your docs about **awaiting results of invokeMethod on Android side**, in flutter you can simply create a Future method and await it, but in Kotlin i don't know how (Currently time racing with Thread.Sleep(50ms)). Any suggestions? Am i doing something wrong? \r\n**I am doing all of this on MainActivity, is this the source of problem?**\r\nI tried to wrap it inside runOnUiThread, but it freezes my UI for the doing, would like to work it as async. \r\n**What are your words on that, what direction will you go next?**\r\n## Logs\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n      Include the full logs of the commands you are running between the lines\r\n      with the backticks below.

    "text": "I think the definition, examples, or naming of the [ScrollDirection](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/ScrollDirection-class.html) enum values are inconsistent with the behaviour, though I'm not sure what the original intent with the naming was.\r\n\r\n*ScrollDirection.forward* says:\r\n\r\n> Scrolling is happening in the positive scroll offset direction.\r\n>\r\n> For example, for the GrowthDirection.forward part of a vertical AxisDirection.down list, this means the content is moving up, exposing lower content. \r\n\r\nI'm finding that for both a RenderViewport with AxisDirection.down and a RenderSliverList in that RenderViewport with GrowthDirection.forward that when I scroll down (i.e. expose lower content), the scroll offsets for both increase from zero (`renderViewport.offset.pixels` and `renderSliverList.constraints.scrollOffset`), but the `userScrollDirection` (`renderViewport.offset.userScrollDirection` and `renderSliverList.constraints.userScrollDirection`) is  ScrollDirection.reverse.  See tests at bottom for a demonstration of the behaviours.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, it seems we need to swap the examples given in the documentation of ScrollDirection.forward and .reverse.  Though I'm wondering if the value returned for userScrollDirection should be switched so that when the user is scrolling down (revealing more data at the bottom) in a AxisDirection.down RenderViewport, and in a RenderSliver in that viewport with growthDirection of GrowthDirection.forward, the userScrollDirection should be forward.  However, at the same time, I wonder if switching that behaviour would cause problems for existing client code.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to fix this issue and submit a PR, but I'm not sure what the preferred solution would be.\r\n\r\n### Demonstration tests\r\n\r\nThese tests demo the issue.  I would expect all of them to pass if the documentation for ScrollDirection.forward was correct; however, the tests for ScrollDirection fail while the tests for offset pass (as noted by comments

    "text": "I ran into something that I found quite unexpecting when trying to play a video in the background, covering the entire device.\r\n\r\nToo me, it seems like a `FittetBox(fit: BoxFit.cover)` with a `AspectRatio()` would be a prefect fit. But unfortunately, they don't really work together. Here was the full tree of my first attempt:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nFittetBox(\r\n  fit: BoxFit.cover,\r\n  child: AspectRatio(\r\n    aspectRatio: 750 / 1624,\r\n    child: VideoPlayer(),\r\n  ),\r\n),\r\n```\r\n\r\n`VideoPlayer` here is from the [`video_player` package](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/video_player), but could be any widget that just draws on whatever size they get, not imposing any constraints themselves.\r\n\r\nI _think_ that the problem here is that the `FittedBox` will try to layout it's child, then look at the width and height, and scale that while maintaining an aspect ration to fit the box.\r\n\r\nWhat I would really like in this case though, is to just read the aspect ratio from the `AspectRatio` child, and then calculate the appropriate width and height from that.\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to have a special case in `FittedBox` for `AspectRatio`, or is this just not how it's supposed to work? 🤔 \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFor anyone facing the same problem, it can be solved by replacing `AspectRatio(aspectRatio: 750 / 1624)` with `SizedBox(width: 750, height: 1624)`. The `SizedBox` will be scaled to the correct size, while maintaining the aspect ratio.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Put the above code into a flutter app\r\n2. Add a video controller with any video file\r\n3. Run app and watch results\r\n\r\n## Logs\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnalyzing flutter...                                                    \r\nNo issues found!

You define a requestCode in your plugin that you trigger the intent and that requestCode is then sent to the onActivityResult callback when the intent finishes.\r\n\r\nMy question is: since multiple flutter plugins can register onActivityResult via PluginRegistry.ActivityResultListener, how we can avoid collision between request codes? I mean two plugins request codes can easily be the same, which will result both plugin methods triggered? And if those two methods expect different shape of data it may cause NPE."

However, we found out that once we use the cached flutter engine, those methods are no longer working. What we have to do now is to convert the top-most widget (MyApp) into a stateful widget, and listen to the platform channel (event channel) and build the widget accordingly.\r\n\r\nCoder can achieve it by themselves, but I think the framework can have some support to reduce the boilerplate code."

You know the linux platform has a libc(glibc) to provide the interface for application to access the kernel's services.

The reason why we need access to the `route` instance is because its `_navigator` property is initialized after it was pushed to the stack.\r\n\r\nAt some point, we would like to replace the `NewPageWidget` with a another page (it's a requirement, I cannot use `pushReplacement()` or any other method for that matter), but without access to the original `route` instance that originally placed the page on the stack, how exactly can `replace(oldRoute, newRoute)` work?\r\n\r\nA deadlock?

To do this, I'm simply drawing them using canvas.drawArc in a CustomPainter widget. I'm using a StatefulWidget to increment the progress indicator. Just displaying this alone works on both iOS and Android.\r\n[Here's a picture of what that looks like.](https://i.imgur.com/ThXgmEa.png)\r\n\r\nI also have a background that I paint behind the rings using another custom paint. I display the background and rings using a Stack widget \r\n\r\n```\r\nStack(children: <Widget>[\r\n          RingsBackground(),\r\n          CustomPaint(\r\n            size: Size(200, 200),\r\n            painter: CirclePainter(streak: streak),\r\n          ),\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I include the background and increment the progress indicator past a certain point I get very buggy results on Android but not iOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[What it looks like on a HuaWei Mate SE running Oreo](https://i.imgur.com/6kttEdU.jpg)\r\n[What it looks like in Android emulation running Pie](https://i.imgur.com/mRzfoWE.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, if I switch to another app and switch back, the rings display and increment properly (in both the emulator and on the real device. \r\n\r\nThe background includes some relatively complicated stuff to get the inset shadow effect that I created. If I simplify the background to a single grey arc, this problem disappears on my device but persists on the android emulator.\r\n\r\n## Logs\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n      Run your application with `flutter run --verbose` and attach all the\r\n      log output below between the lines with the backticks.

In the output window, unlike when you swipe up -- there is no \"Application Ended.\" message and connection is not lost to whatever magic thing is running for debug stuff.  When you swipe up you do get the message and \"flutter run\" quits.\r\n\r\nb.  About 50% of the time, on the next innovation of  \"flutter run\" we see an exception thrown (see logs) about Keystore errors.  This doesn't seem to affect the running of the app (?) but it's a bit nerve wracking... \r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. From a `WillPopScope _onWillPop` .. call `SystemNavigator.pop()` to end the app.\r\n2. do a \"flutter run -d\" on an Android emulator device (I don't have a physical device) \r\n3. Hit the Back-button (or whatever to invoke the `SystemNavigator.pop()` .. \r\n\r\nNotice that in the debug window the flutter run is still running and no \"Application Finished\" message is presented.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Logs\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n      Run your application with `flutter run --verbose` and attach all the\r\n      log output below between the lines with the backticks. If there is an\r\n      exception, please see if the error message includes enough information\r\n      to explain how to solve the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsing hardware rendering with device Android SDK built for x86.

Guarding it with State.mounted is not working.\r\n\r\nIf I call the method before super.dispose()\r\n```dart\r\n    void foo() {\r\n      if (this.mounted) setState((){...});\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @override\r\n    void dispose() {\r\n      foo();\r\n      super.dispose();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThen I get this error, showing that setState() was called:\r\n\r\n    The following assertion was thrown while finalizing the widget tree:\r\n    flutter: 'package:flutter/src/widgets/framework.dart': Failed assertion: line 3473 pos 12:\r\n    flutter: '_debugLifecycleState != _ElementLifecycle.defunct': is not true.\r\n    flutter:\r\n    flutter: Either the assertion indicates an error in the framework itself, or we should provide substantially\r\n    flutter: more information in this error message to help you determine and fix the underlying cause.\r\n    flutter: In either case, please report this assertion by filing a bug on GitHub:\r\n    flutter:   https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/new?template=BUG.md\r\n    flutter:\r\n    flutter: When the exception was thrown, this was the stack:\r\n    flutter: #2      Element.markNeedsBuild (package:flutter/src/widgets/framework.dart:3473:12)\r\n    flutter: #3      State.setState (package:flutter/src/widgets/framework.dart:1146:14)\r\n    flutter: #4      _SubWidgetState.foo (package:experimental.sparklight.prototypes.audioplugintester/src/sub_widget.dart:44:9)\r\n    flutter: #5      _SubWidgetState.dispose (package:experimental.sparklight.prototypes.audioplugintester/src/sub_widget.dart:52:5)\r\n    flutter: #6      StatefulElement.unmount (package:flutter/src/widgets/framework.dart:3900:12)\r\n\r\n\r\nI acknowledge that this makes some sense, as super.dispose() has not been run, so the superclass cleanup has not take place yet, so [mounted] is still true.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I move the foo() to _after_ super.dispose():\r\n```dart\r\n    void foo() {\r\n      if (this.mounted) setState((){...});\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @override\r\n    void dispose() {\r\n      super.dispose();\r\n      foo();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nI get a different message (but a similar-looking stack)\r\n\r\n    [VERBOSE-2:shell.cc(184)] Dart Error: Unhandled exception:\r\n    setState() called after dispose(): _SubWidgetState#68e4a(lifecycle state: defunct)\r\n    This error happens if you call setState() on a State object for a widget that no longer appears in the widget tree (e.g., whose parent widget no longer includes the widget in its build). This error can occur when code calls setState() from a timer or an animation callback. The preferred solution is to cancel the timer or stop listening to the animation in the dispose() callback. Another solution is to check the \"mounted\" property of this object before calling setState() to ensure the object is still in the tree.\r\n    This error might indicate a memory leak if setState() is being called because another object is retaining a reference to this State object after it has been removed from the tree. To avoid memory leaks, consider breaking the reference to this object during dispose().\r\n\r\n     When the exception was thrown, this was the stack:\r\n    flutter: #0      State.setState.<anonymous closure> (package:flutter/src/widgets/framework.dart:1103:9)\r\n    flutter: #1      State.setState (package:flutter/src/widgets/framework.dart:1129:6)\r\n    flutter: #2      _SubWidgetState.foo (package:experimental.sparklight.prototypes.audioplugintester/src/sub_widget.dart:44:9)\r\n    flutter: #3      _SubWidgetState.dispose (package:experimental.sparklight.prototypes.audioplugintester/src/sub_widget.dart:55:5)\r\n    flutter: #4      StatefulElement.unmount (package:flutter/src/widgets/framework.dart:3900:12)\r\n\r\nshowing that [mounted] is still true. This contradicts the comments in framework.dart for dispose():\r\n\r\n  \r\n    /// The framework calls this method when this [State] object will never\r\n    /// build again. After the framework calls [dispose], the [State] object is\r\n    /// considered unmounted and the [mounted] property is false. It is an error\r\n    /// to call [setState] at this point. This stage of the lifecycle is terminal:\r\n    /// there is no way to remount a [State] object that has been disposed.\r\n\r\nand for setState()\r\n\r\n    /// It is an error to call this method after the framework calls [dispose].\r\n    /// You can determine whether it is legal to call this method by checking\r\n    /// whether the [mounted] property is true.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOthers have suggested adding my own ivar flag (i.e. _isDisposing, which is set to true at the start of my overridden State.dispose() and used as the guard in foo()) or multiple versions of foo() (i.e. foo() and fooWithoutSetState()). However, I'd prefer to not have to track the State lifecycle myself, nor add extra complexity in the number of methods. \r\nThanks for looking! \r\n  \r\n\r\n  "

But in practice I see about 150 logical pixels per inch.  For example, a Galaxy Tab A `MediaQuery` returns 1280x800 (physically it is 1920x1200, the `devicePixelRatio` is reported correctly at 1.5).  Its longest side is about 8.5\" with 1280 logical pixels.  Also, drawing fixed size boxes show the same pixel ratios.  The Nexus 10 tablet has similar logical figures (`devicePixelRatio` is there 2.0, which is correct).\r\n\r\nIs the above referred documentation wrong?"

The scrollview was appropriately aligned and the overscroll indicators and refresh indicators are visible.\r\n\r\nI think the documentation here is misleading as it seems to suggest that these absorbers and injectors are necessary in order to use the `NestedScrollView` correctly, and it does not indicate the exact scenario when these special widgets are required (if they are required at all anymore).\r\n\r\nMaybe the documentation should be updated to contain a simpler example that targets the simplest most common use case (that is, a scrolling app bar shared across multiple tabs / pages)."

Then, scroll up, you will see initState called for ... \" for entries where initState has already been called.\r\n\r\nThis causes a problem, because we might be doing some expensive operations in initState.

If I comment out GestureDetector part, TextField works.\r\nFurther, you can comment out first two widgets in stack and uncomment last one to check other issue- when GestureDetector has child. I would expect that no tap is passed to child but child receives input and GestureDetector does not.\r\n\r\n```\r\nflutter doctor\r\nDoctor summary (to see all details, run flutter doctor -v):\r\n[✓] Flutter (Channel master, v0.5.5-pre.10, on Mac OS X 10.13.4 17E202, locale en-US)\r\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK 27.0.3)\r\n[✓] iOS toolchain - develop for iOS devices (Xcode 9.4)\r\n[✓] Android Studio (version 3.1)\r\n[!] IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (version 2018.1.2)\r\n    ✗ Flutter plugin not installed; this adds Flutter specific functionality.\r\n    ✗ Dart plugin not installed; this adds Dart specific functionality.\r\n[✓] Connected devices (2 available)\r\n\r\n```"

So far I understood that it gives you the chance to propagate data down the Widget tree. In extreme if you put is as RootWidget it will be accessible from all Widgets in the tree on all Routes, which is fine because somehow I have to make my ViewModel/Model accessible for my Widgets without having to resort to globals or Singletons.\r\n\r\nBUT InheritedWidget is immutable, so how can I update it? And more important how are my Stateful Widgets triggered to rebuild their subtrees?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the documentation is here very unclear and after discussion with a lot of people including @brianegan nobody seems really to know what the correct way of using it.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your great work!

When the build function is on StatefulWidget, that means you'll capture the widget, which can change when the parent rebuilds. With the build function on the State, you capture the State object, which persists across rebuilds. You can still access the widget using the |widget| property, but that property always leads to the latest widget even if the parent rebuilds.\r\n\r\nThis video also explains it in different terms: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkyY9WCGMi0"

The two cases we have seen involve size-dependent layouts containing animation-relevant information not present at the widget level. That moves animation code into the rendering layer, and it would be nice to have a standard way of accomplishing that."
