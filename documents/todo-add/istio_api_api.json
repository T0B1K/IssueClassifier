[{"labels":["api",null],"text":"Quota spec binding is used to bind mixer quota resource name to a proxy. It's done through an intermediary called `IstioService` (see https://github.com/istio/api/blob/14a33dbe9d2d387b06dbf2da68bb22581c0f20f4/mixer/v1/config/client/quota.proto#L126). We should re-consider how quotas are selected at the server-side sidecar in light of the deprecation of IstioService and v1alpha1 APIs.\r\n\r\ncc @geeknoid @ayj @louiscryan "}]
