(i think)\n\nnow, i must admit i do not use three js for displaying so this format may be required for three to display the animation correctly. if this is the case i guess i will just have to come up with some method to remove the non-vital frame data. the difference should be considerable: i estimate a reduction of 75-90% in animation data size from sampling the ratio between keyframes and non

node to *never* prune the blockchain. \r\n\r\n<!--- what behavior did you expect? -->\r\n\r\n**actual behavior**\r\n\r\noccasionally, bitcoin core will enable the pruning option. this causes it to prune the blockchain, and forces me to resync when i disable it.  i started seeing this in 0.19 and it still persists in 0.20. it may also be related to my moving to a new computer which upgraded me to catalina. i'm not really sure.\r\n  \r\n<!--- what was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is gui-related)? -->\r\n\r\n**to reproduce**\r\n\r\ni think it might be related to the fact that my data directory is on an external hard drive. if i start bitcoin core before mounting in the drive, it will popup the dialog as if it is my first time starting bitcoin core, asking me where to store the block chain. in the dialog, the datadir location is defaulted to put it in the location where my external hard drive mount would be, like `/volumes/drive/bitcoin`. if i then mount the drive and choose next in the dialog, the sync works, but pruning is enabled and it immediately prunes the blockchain. i can go into the settings at this point and uncheck pruning, but at that point, it requires a full resync. and it ends up being enabled again the next time i start bitcoin core. needless to say, this is extremely annoying and makes bitcoin core almost unusable for me.\r\n\r\ni even tried setting `prune=0` in my bitcoin.conf file, which is on the external drive, but it has no effect. \r\n\r\ni suspect what is happening is that pruning is enabled by default, and since it can't find my datadir when it launches, bitcoin core thinks that it is doing a fresh sync and sets it to true. this setting is then not updated, even from the bitcoin.conf (which itself lives on the external drive) once that datadir is loaded. the fact that it remembers where the datadir is implies that some settings are stored locally, though i can't really tell where. is it possible for me to store my no-prune setting locally as well? \r\n\r\nnote that i used to do this exact workflow of opening bitcoin core before mounting my drive all the time in previous node versions and macos versions, and it never enabled pruning on me. \r\n\r\n(as an aside, i feel like bitcoin core should be smart enough to recognize that a datadir in `/volumes` on macos is an external drive, even when it doesn't currently exist). \r\n\r\n<!--- how reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n**system information**\r\n\r\n<!-- what version of bitcoin core are you

model that needs to be broken down into 3 chunks and my modified offset array looks like this:\n\n```\n[{\n  startindex : 0,\n  startposition : 0,\n  startnormal : 0,\n  countindex : 195771,\n

desktop and my laptop that i need to sync files between, and a dedicated aws ec2 instance for backups and so that stuff still get synced if both of my computers aren't on at the same time. (they usually aren't.)\r\n\r\nfirst i set it up on the aws instance, then i set it up on my macbook. i set things synchronizing and after a couple of hiccups i had a couple folders duplicated on the dedicated server. (per hiccups: syncing slows down massively when the gui is open?? i mean, i get why this could happen, but some kind of notice in the gui would have been really helpful, i spent like an hour troubleshooting why network would be having problems that could explain the slow transfer rate when in fact it all had to do with the gui.)\r\n\r\nthen i set it up on windows. i have been using dropbox up to now, and the reason i'm setting up syncthing is because dropbox is ending support for my macbook's os. this means that all the files i need to sync were already being synchronized by dropbox. i shared the smaller of the two folders i've been trying out with syncthing between all the devices and everything was great. syncthing recognized right away that everything was already synchronized. then i shared the larger one and things were fine at first, but then my macbook and the aws instance both started getting confused.\r\n\r\n# what happened next\r\n\r\nexcept for when i pause the larger folder being shared, both my macbook and the aws instance are reporting very high cpu usage. the gui shows the folder in a \"failed files\" state. syncthing seemed to be repeatedly scanning the folder. i did _not_ have this problem when sharing the folder from my macbook with the aws instance, this issue only occurred after adding my windows machine to the bunch.\r\n\r\n# the log\r\n\r\nhere is a portion of the very noisy log from syncthing on osx. the log's frequent mention of symlinks is the reason why i suspect the issue to be connected to symlinks.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ndtxr] 23:08:59 info: puller (folder \"projects\" (mxwe3-xw9bp), file \"pydwarf/df/libs/sdl_ttf.framework/headers/sdl_ttf.h\"): checking parent dirs: traverses symlink: pydwarf/df/libs/sdl_ttf.framework/headers\r\n[ndtxr] 23:08:59 info: puller (folder \"projects\" (mxwe3-xw9bp), file \"pydwarf/df/libs/sdl_ttf.framework/resources/info.plist\"): checking parent dirs: traverses symlink: pydwarf/df/libs/sdl_ttf.framework/resources\r\n[ndtxr] 23:08:59 info: puller (folder \"projects\" (mxwe3-xw9bp), file \"pydwarf/df/libs/sdl_ttf.framework/versions/current/headers/sdl_ttf.h\"): checking parent dirs: traverses symlink: pydwarf/df/libs/sdl_ttf.framework/versions/current\r\n[ndtxr] 23:08:59 info: puller (folder \"projects\" (mxwe3-xw9bp), file \"pydwarf/df/libs/sdl_ttf.framework/versions/current/resources/info.plist\"): checking parent dirs: traverses symlink: pydwarf/df/libs/sdl_ttf.framework/versions/current\r\n[ndtxr] 23:08:59 info: puller (folder \"projects\" (mxwe3-xw9bp), file \"pydwarf/df/libs/sdl.framework/versions/current/headers/sdl_syswm.h\"): checking parent dirs: traverses symlink: pydwarf/df/libs/sdl.framework/versions/current\r\n[ndtxr] 23:08:59 info: puller (folder \"projects\" (mxwe3-xw9bp), file \"rust/hello_world/target/debug/hello_world.dsym/contents/resources/dwarf/hello_world-149ec8b9da1f89ba\"): checking parent dirs: traverses symlink: rust/hello_world/target/debug/hello_world.dsym\r\n[ndtxr] 23:08:59 info: puller (folder \"projects\" (mxwe3-xw9bp), file \"rust/hello_world/target/debug/hello_world.dsym/contents/info.plist\"): checking parent dirs: traverses symlink: rust/hello_world/target/debug/hello_world.dsym\r\n```\r\n"}, {"classified_as": "enhancement", "text": "please, see video: http://screencast.com/t/xaixehyl6\n"}, {"classified_as": "bug", "text": "hi, if you instance multiple renderers in multiple div containers, the controls cause a memory leak. for every new instance of the controls they waste about 50mb memory in chrome, wich you can easily see in windows task manager/ressource monitor. \n"}, {"classified_as": "enhancement", "text": "<!-- please only use this template for submitting enhancement requests -->\r\n\r\n**what would you like to be added**:\r\nusing existing configmap or secrete keys create a new environment variable using multiple keys from configmap or environment variable.\r\n\r\nexample:\r\n\r\nenv:\r\n- name: severhost_port\r\n  valuefrom:\r\n    configmapref:\r\n      key: server_host_name:server_host_port\r\n      name: db-server-details\r\n\r\nlike this, it should give me **severhost_port=demosever.demodomain.com:7744**\r\n\r\n**why is this needed**:\r\nwe wanted a minimum object of kubernetes to be created over cluster if above is possible then we can pass data to multiple applications whichever format they needed, like above is key3_data=key1_data=key2_data.

parameter.\r\nthis might warrant too many changes to the inner working of sklearn's model_selection for a use-case that's too specialized (it's hard for me to judge that).\r\nif you think it's worth having this feature, i'm happy to tackle it and discuss what solution might be best.\r\n\r\n#### additional context\r\n\r\nthis problem arises frequently in neuroimaging, where people solve this by

dgram.js:220:7\nat nexttickcallbackwith3args (node.js:452:9)\nat process._tickcallback (node.js:358:17)\n```\n\nthis seems to happen because node.js attaches an own eventhandler to the `listening` event which will try to send messages that were enqueued before, but have not been sent (https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/lib/dgram.js#l288-l293).  this closure might run after a user event handler which might close the socket (like mine does if it fails to join a multicast group). when it runs and tries to send messages on the already closed socket an exception is thrown which can not be captured by the user, because it's not on his callstack.\n\nwhat should be done to avoid that:\n- the `listening` handler should check if the socket is still open before starting to send enqueued messages and should simply return if it's no longer open.\n- the `close()` function should flush the sendqueue, which would also avoid that the handler does attempt to send anything.\n\nactually the second part is more part, because it seems that currently the callbacks for those queued sends are also never called if the socket is closed before connecting and because it would already solve the issue. however another sanity check in the `listening` handler would still be ok.\n\nworkarounds: \n- don't send anything before listening is emitted\n- don't close the socket or do any complex logic in the `listening` handler, but defer the custom logic in a new eventloop tick.\n\nmy code for reproduction:\n\n```\nclass multicastsocket {\n// ...\n\nopen() {\n  this._socket =

} catch (e) {\n      console.error('adding multicast group membership failed')        \n      this._closesocket(); // the socket is closed here inside the event listener\n    }\n

has a bias making data points' anomaly scores lower than what they actually should be. this problem arises for areas in the space which are axis-aligned with a cluster. imagine a point very far from a cluster, the basic isolation forest algorithm may assign it a lower anomaly score only because the point is axis aligned with the cluster. this does lead to false negative in my application.\r\n\r\nto overcome this bias, [hariri et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02141) proposed the extended isolation forest algorithm. while the normal isolation forests algorithm randomly chooses a feature and a threshold value to split the points, the extended version uses a random hyperplane to do so. those random hyperplanes, as they might not be axis-aligned, remove the bias caused by the standard algorithm. in the end, the standard algorithm becomes a subset of the extended version one, but using only axis-aligned hyperplanes.\r\n\r\nplease have a look to the original paper, it explains the problem very well.\r\n\r\n#### describe your proposed solution\r\n\r\ni had a look to the isolation forest code, in my humble opinion, the simplest solution might be to add an argument to the `isolationforest` class constructor to choose how the samples should be split into two. maybe something like an `extended` argument.\r\n\r\nthis would basically modify the `splitter` argument passed to the underlying base_estimator (an extratreeregressor instance). we could add a \"random_hyperplane\" splitting mode, which requires implementing a new `splitter` class.\r\n\r\nglobally, this is not a lot of changes but adding the new splitter class. i can work on an implementation if we agree this is a useful addition.\r\n\r\n#### describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\r\n\r\nmaybe

`this.read(0)`. this triggers `onstreamread()` to be called, which does `stream.push(null)` and eventually results in the close event. this is a little weird because stdin isn't a readable stream :)\r\n\r\nin node 8.11.4 this worked because `child_process.js:createsocket()` called the `socket` constructor with `options.readable === undefined`. so the `socket` constructor sees that `options.readable !== false` and runs `this.read(0)`\r\n\r\nin pr #18701 `createsocket()` was changed to call the `socket` constructor with `options.readable === true`. this stops `this.read(0)` from

children so the parent object can handle custom raycasting for the child objects.\r\n\r\n**use case**\r\n\r\ni'm currently writing a [3d tiles renderer library for three.js](https://github.com/nasa-ammos/3dtilesrendererjs/) and i would like to take advantage of the bounding volume hierarchy for raycasting. for context the 3d tiles format specifies a hierarchy of geometry that is swapped out as the camera gets closer. each level of the tree has a bounding box that encapsulates all the child tiles. the bounding hierarchy should be able to be used to improve raycast performance by culling parts of the potentially deep tree more quickly. in the library all visible tiles viewable by the camera are added as children of a parent group called tilinggroup.\r\n\r\ni would like to perform the hierarchy check in `tilinggroup.raycast` and only call `intersectobjects` on the geometry within the appropriate bounds. however the way raycaster works right now [all children are always traversed](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/core/raycaster.js#l49-l65), which means there's no opportunity to check the the bounding tree before performing raycasts.\r\n\r\none approach would be to allow `raycast` to return a boolean which would prevent the raycaster from traversing the groups children, but that might not play nice with the new layers functionality. another option would be to move some of the raycast traversal logic into `object3d.raycast` so it can be overridden.\r\n\r\nmaybe there are some other suggestions? i've looked a few different options but so far i've come up empty.\r\n\r\nthanks!"}, {"classified_as": "enhancement", "text": "this feature request came out of a brief discussion on twitter with @gaearon: https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/820356665899945984\r\n\r\n`__react_devtools_global_hook__.inject` exposes access to `getclosestinstancefromnode`, `getnodefrominstance`, `reactmount` and `reactreconciler`. this is great, and we use it to collect component level performance metrics for our customers in production, however, there are more things we'd love to have access to for the purpose of helping our users pinpoint performance issues in their applications.\r\n\r\nthis \"issue\" includes some initial observations, but i hope we can keep an open dialogue about this - in particular considering fiber will probably change the landscape with regards to what the most common performance problems are and we'd instrument according to that.\r\n\r\ni understand the urge to keep the api surface area as small as possible in order to create minimal commitment to apis to allow for internals to move fast. exposing additional internals with the explicit warning that you are not committed to their api is fine for us, as a tool vendor.\r\n\r\nwe've looked at using `batchedupdates` to highlight the batched nature of the work performed by react. e.g. is the work in your application getting batched properly. if we only have access to the component updating methods on `reactreconciler` (`mountcomponent`, `receivecomponent`, `unmountcomponent` etc) we can't really know when a batch of work starts and when it ends. `batchedupdates` is available in reactdom with the `unstable_` prefix, but exposing it in the `inject` hook would be very useful: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/reactdom.js#l38\r\n\r\nwe've also (experimentally) hooked into `eventpluginutils.executedispatchesinorder` in order to capture events and measure the work resulting from these, but i suspect there is a better place to do this (`reacteventlistener.dispatchevent`?). in any case, having access to the event system would be very useful. again, using the \"unstable_\" prefix to indicate non-committal would be fine for us.\r\n\r\ni've not had much time to look into what we'd need access to for fiber instrumentation, but so far it looks like a hook into `beginwork` would be very useful: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/199db638c4d0fbc6e4d99534be0060deea518a32/src/renderers/shared/fiber/reactfiberbeginwork.js#l640"},

summary: to hook the requiring of a file with multiple extensions without specifying it, you must:\n1. set `require.extensions` for the **last component** of the extension to your hook function\n2. set `require.extensions` for the **entire extension** to any value.\n\nthis is due to differences in how `module._findpath` and `module.load` deal with extensions: the former adds each extension in `require.extensions` to the basename and tests it for existence (via `tryextensions`). the latter works the other way around; it removes everything up to the last part of the extension (via `path.extname`) and then checks if it is present in `require.extensions`.\n\ni know it's policy not to fix bugs in `module` that might help compile-to-js languages, but i figure someone else might come across the same problem and this report could be useful to them.\n"}, {"classified_as": "enhancement", "text": "* **version**: 8x-9x\r\n* **platform**: windows 7 x64\r\n* **subsystem**:

https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6212.\r\n\r\n## situation\r\n\r\nthe [`focusable` attribute](https://www.w3.org/tr/svgtiny12/interact.html#focusable-attr) from the svg specifications is an [enumerated attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#keywords-and-enumerated-attributes) accepting values `\"true\"`, `\"false\"` and `\"auto\"`. because it is technically not a boolean attribute (although it certainly somehow looks like it), react expects the value to be passed as a string. see the following example:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-<svg focusable>i should be focusable</svg>\r\n-<svg focusable={true}>i should be focusable</svg>\r\n+<svg focusable='true'>i should be focusable</svg>\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe thing is, the `focusable` attribute is often used in conjunction with elements from the aria specification, in which attributes are booleans and not enumerated attributes with `\"true\"` and `\"false\"` values. the [`aria-hidden` attribute](https://www.w3.org/tr/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-hidden) is a good example of that.\r\n\r\nfor instance, [following a good practice for icon-buttons](https://fvsch.com/code/svg-icons/#section-html):\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button type=\"button\">\r\n  <svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\">\r\n    <use xlink:href=\"#icon-play\"></use>\r\n  </svg>\r\n  <span class=\"access-label\">start playback</span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nfrom an authoring perspective, the above snippet would likely be written like this in jsx:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<button type='button'>\r\n  <icon icon='play' aria-hidden={true} focusable={false} />\r\n  <span class='access-label'>start playback</span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe problem is that `focusable` **cannot** be authored as a boolean, otherwise it will **not** be printed out in the dom. on the other hand, `aria-hidden` is perfectly fine being written as a boolean at it gets coerced by react.\r\n\r\n## proposal\r\n\r\ngiven the default value for the `focusable` attribute is `\"auto\"`, this is very likely this attribute gets authored to change its value to `true` or `false`. in that regard, it is confusing that it has to be specified as a string, when other attributes accepting booleans can be authored as such.\r\n\r\nthe suggestion would be to make it possible for `focusable` to be specified as either a boolean or a string, like other similar attributes. in other words, all the following should work:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<svg focusable>i should be focusable</svg>\r\n<svg focusable={true}>i should be focusable</svg>\r\n<svg focusable='true'>i should be focusable</svg>\r\n<svg focusable={false}>i should not be focusable</svg>\r\n<svg focusable='false'>i should not be focusable</svg>\r\n<svg focusable='auto'>i should be focusable</svg>\r\n```\r\n\r\nfrom an authoring perspective, i believe this

loaded. particularly useful if a sound is used at a lot of different positions (like 'medieval' torch burning in my case for example).\n2) if you want to go further, and more powerful/generic, we could provide directly a way to connect an audio source/node to three.audio (instead of a buffer or file), which would open all (or almost) the possibilities of the webaudio api while still benefiting from three.audio functionality\n3) maybe a way to add/remove filter in three.audio, instead of just setting one (which is already a big plus), but it would maybe become too complicated/cumbersome...\n\nwhat do other peoples think of this ? any idea ?\nif it is interesting and possible to have that in three, i could try and do an implementation candidate for a pull

`activemipmaplevel` are not saved and restored. you basically need something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar currentrendertarget = renderer.getrendertarget(); \r\nvar currentactivecubeface =

ensure that the default parameter for the `framebuffertexture2d()` call is set correctly. it does not solve the issue that the original values of `activecubeface` and `activemipmaplevel` are not restored.\r\n\r\ni'm not sure how to solve this problem but making `.activecubeface` and `.activemipmaplevel` properties of `webglrendertargetcube` again and performing the necessary

wondering if it would be possible to support nesting with `input-groups`.  my use case is that i am using angular 5 and have written a dropdown button component with the template being the following\r\n\r\nbelow is the template for component named `question-dropdown-button`\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"input-group-append\" ngbdropdown>\r\n  <button ngbdropdowntoggle class=\"btn btn-outline-secondary dropdown-toggle\" type=\"button\" data-toggle=\"dropdown\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-expanded=\"false\">dropdown</button>\r\n  <div ngbdropdownmenu class=\"dropdown-menu\">\r\n

role=\"separator\" class=\"dropdown-divider\"></div>\r\n    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#\">separated link</a>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\ni then use this component anywhere that i need it, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"input-group\">\r\n  <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" />\r\n  <question-dropdown-button></question-dropdown-button>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen loading this does not apply the border radius correctly to the dropdown button even though this is in an `input-group-append`.  looking at the generated css i believe this is down to the combinator that is used and relies on the `input-group-append` being a child of the `input-group` class.\r\n\r\nin the case of angular 5 and it's component rendering the following is the html output\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div _ngcontent-c12=\"\" class=\"input-group\">\r\n  <input _ngcontent-c12=\"\" class=\"form-control\" type=\"text\">\r\n  <question-dropdown-button _ngcontent-c12=\"\"
