From the document, it looks I should use query strings.\r\n\r\njs\r\n    await import(\"x-esm\") //\u2192 Found as expected\r\n    await import(\"./node_modules/x-esm/index.js?q=0\") //\u2192 Found and x-esm re-ran as expected\r\n    await import(\"./node_modules/x-esm/index.js?q=1\") //\u2192 Found and x-esm re-ran as expected\r\n\r\n\r\nx-esm is an ES module package. It worked as expected.\r\n\r\njs\r\n    const cjs = await import(\"x-cjs\") //\u2192 Found as expected\r\n    const cjs0 = await import(\"./node_modules/x-cjs/index.js?q=0\") //\u2192 Found but x-cjs didn't re-run\r\n    const cjs1 = await import(\"./node_modules/x-cjs/index.js?q=1\") //\u2192 Found but x-cjs didn't re-run\r\n    console.log(cjs === cjs0, cjs === cjs1, cjs0 === cjs1) //\u2192 all are false but x-cjs didn't run three times\r\n\r\n\r\nx-cjs is a CJS package. The result was odd. The console.log() in x-cjs package ran only one time, but the returned values are different for each query string.\r\n\r\nI found the entry of x-cjs in require.cache. However, the cache entry is odd as well. It's different from require(\"x-cjs\"), the entry doesn't have parent property and the module.children of test.js is still empty.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I tried to remove the cache entry.\r\n\r\njs\r\n    console.log(\"---- remove 'require.cache' ----\")\r\n    delete require.cache[require.resolve(\"x-cjs\")]\r\n    await import(\"x-cjs\") //\u2192 Found but x-cjs didn't re-run\r\n    await import(\"./node_modules/x-cjs/index.js?q=0\") //\u2192 Found but x-cjs didn't re-run\r\n    await import(\"./node_modules/x-cjs/index.js?q=1\") //\u2192 Found but x-cjs didn't re-run\r\n    await import(\"./node_modules/x-cjs/index.js?q=2\") //\u2192 Found and x-cjs re-ran as expected\r\n    await import(\"./node_modules/x-cjs/index.js?q=3\") //\u2192 Found but x-cjs didn't re-run\r\n\r\n\r\nCryptic. I guess this behavior is:\r\n\r\n- import(cjs) has cache apart from require.cache.\r\n- The import(cjs) cache is created from require.cache.\r\n- It runs CJS package only if require.cache entry was not found.\r\n- The import(cjs) cache is not removed even if require.cache entry deleted.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I have to do the following steps if I want to import packages without cache.\r\n\r\n1. Find the main file of the package because I cannot put query strings to the package name.\r\n   js\r\n   const url = \"file:\" + require.resolve(packageName) + uniqueQueryString;\r\n   \r\n1. Import it.\r\n   js\r\n   const ret = await import(url);\r\n   \r\n1. Delete require.cache entry.\r\n   js\r\n   delete require.cache[require.resolve(packageName)];\r\n   \r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\n1. Is it intentional behavior that import(cjs) creates incomplete require.cache entries?\r\n1.

And this is crazy! \ud83d\ude05 \r\n\r\nAnd it gets worse now when my User model has more than 10 relationships.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nJust request the minimum information: they key to show in the dropdown selector.\r\n\r\n#### System\r\n- Node.js version: v12\r\n- NPM version: v6\r\n- Strapi version: v3.0.0-beta.18.2\r\n- Database: MongoDB\r\n- Operating system: macOS\r\n"}, {"classified_as": "enhancement", "text": "rel/details: https://github.com/playproject-io/datdot-substrate/issues/18\r\n\r\nWhen we make the same extrinsic call using multiple accounts (calling signAndSend on the same extrinsic using multiple pairs) practically simultaneously, the callback object appears to return the same events for every call - when each call should in reality return unique events.\r\n\r\nHere is the exact code where this occurs:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/joshua-mir/datdot-service/blob/e5ee50b3b5080c9cafaae71cae9deff2e6ec249b/index.js#L175-L228\r\n\r\nI have confirmed that we see every expected event separately in the UI - so this appears to be an issue specific to events in callbacks."}, {"classified_as": "bug", "text": "@afollestad \r\nIs there a problem with the latest build tools version, or did you just forget to update it?
