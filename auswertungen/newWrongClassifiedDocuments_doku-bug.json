says\r\n\r\n> even though real hovering isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possible on most touchscreens, most mobile browsers emulate hovering support and make `:hover` \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sticky\". in other words, `:hover` styles start applying after tapping an element and only stop applying after the user taps some other element.\r\n\r\nthis is not completely correct. currently, it seems that only ios/safari (and other ios browsers using webkit) has issues with sticky `:hover` under certain conditions. seems limited to links, buttons. here, `:hover` style remains applied, and other styles like `:focus` and `:active` are ignored. `:focus` does \"stick\" in all mobile browsers, even in ios for controls like \"faked\" `<span ...>` based buttons or similar.\r\n\r\nthe prose itself, if we want to keep it, would need some rejigging, making it clear that `:hover` stickyness is an ios/safari only problem.\r\n\r\nthe workaround mentioned - relating to the `hover` mixin, is currently commented out and non-working. we should just remove mention of it (perhaps include some other advice, or just that we're not doing anything special here to prevent this sticking at this stage). and deprecate the mixin properly (@mdo mentioned \"`@include hover { }` just returns a normal `:hover`?\").\r\n\r\nrelated: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/25182\r\n\r\nhoping that for 4.1 we can experiment with using the upcoming `:focus-visible` https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#the-focusring-pseudo pseudo-class with polyfill, to fix sticky `:focus` as a result of touch (and mouse). and that hopefully we can find an ios/safari specific hack or workaround to fix the sticky `:hover` that occurs in certain situations just on this platform."}, {"classified_as": "bug", "text": "in both

{"classified_as": "doku", "text": "hello all.\n\ni'd first like to preface this with a little about myself. i am the primary maintainer for the [drupal bootstrap](https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap) base-theme. it currently has over 60k installs, so needless to say we get a lot of our own issues.\n\nrecently, i started the task of trying to tackle better anchor and scrolling support in the base-theme. support for anchors or scrolling to them has always been a big pain, for not only me, but also a lot of others; especially when dealing with fixed navbars [[jsbin](http://jsbin.com/qimuqu/2)].\n\nthe code i currently have in the project was rather hack-ish and completely un-configurable (my feeble attempt to satisfy a growing issue), so i set out to tackle this once and for all [https://www.drupal.org/node/2462645]. i've poured over countless blogs, docs, support forums and even found a few in this project's issue queue [#193, #1768, #11854].\n\nthe \"solutions\" vary from css to js, but more often than not require at least some sort of manual configuration for it to work with that specific theme/offset requirement.\n\nultimately though, i've determined that a css-only solution just doesn't really cut it; especially when dealing with dynamic and varying content as such in cms framework like drupal. so, i've created the following js based plugin instead:\n\nhttps://github.com/markcarver/bootstrap-anchor [[demo/docs](http://markcarver.github.io/bootstrap-anchor/)]\n\nin an effort to offset the \"cost\" for using js, i was also inspired with the recent addition using anchor.js for bootstrap's own documentation (#14897, #15491). this got me to thinking how this could easily be expanded from bootstrap's own tooltip plugin, like popovers are. what makes it even more enticing is that there has been a `glyphicon-link` available to use for quite a while.\n\nsince both tooltips and popovers are completely opt-in with no data api support, it made sense to follow in that direction; especially for those who still want/need a css-only solution.\n\nmy ultimate goal/desire is to merge this upstream into bootstrap directly. i'm sure this will be a daunting task which is why i'm creating this issue now to get some feedback and eyes on this plugin so it can be flushed out a bit more. i'm still working on documentation of all the new options, so bare that in mind.\n\ni look forward to y'alls feedback!\n"}, {"classified_as": "bug", "text": "### version information\r\n\r\nsyncthing

comprise the fitted parameters (i shall refer to them as `state_params`, this is different than `fit_params`, i believe those are just `**kwargs` which get passed to `estimator.fit()`). if model classes implement a small api specifying which parameters are necessary, it's pretty easy to write any sort of serializer for the model (json, protobuf, whatever).\r\n\r\ni can achieve similar

"`three.firstpersoncontrols` are not working, the view is jumpy, and dragged down. keyboard works fine, the problem is with mouse. it worked fine with dev build from april 13, not now (april 15). i did not updated browser (chrome dev) nor my project in this time. i just came to my project today, updated to latest three.js, and bam, broken.\n\ni see there is nothing changed in the class itself, nor in `three.clock` class, so i don't know what might get broken.\n\nwhat i do:\n\n``` javascript\n//\n// scene and renderer preparations\n//\nvar clock = new three.clock();\nvar camera = new three.perspectivecamera(/*params*/);\nvar control = new three.firstpersoncontrols(camera, renderer.domelement);\n//\n// more preparations\n//\n\nframe();\n\nfunction frame() {\n    requestanimationframe(frame);\n    control.update(clock.getdelta());\n    // do something with scene\n    renderer.render(scene, camera);\n}\n```\n\nis there something i should do to adjust to some new change?\n"}]
