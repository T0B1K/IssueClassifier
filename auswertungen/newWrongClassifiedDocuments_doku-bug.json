Specifically this line `To access your MailHog inbox, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8025. ` is being missed by users due to it appearing to be in the Linux specific setup instructions rather than applicable to all users.  \r\n\r\nThese users are therefore attempting to use a link copied out of the console window in which Mailhog is running. However this provides a `source` view of the email which is in an encoded form.\r\n\r\nThis means that a simple copy and paste into browser will fail as the encoded version has '=' replaced by '=3D' and soft line breaks (represented by an = symbol) inserted to keep line length below 76 characters.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26827682/39624992-66fdb834-4f93-11e8-8ed0-a8896c70e4a2.png)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is possible they miss this entry in the console and try and pull a link out of further up the console output where the link is also polluted with end of line characters (eg \\r\\n) and the ampersand is represented in unicode - \\u0026. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26827682/39625196-4bf52210-4f94-11e8-815f-8dac38eb16eb.png)\r\n\r\nSee also comment on issue #15838:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26827682/39625453-5db91622-4f95-11e8-8e64-3def4330ce48.png)\r\n\r\nThe solution is just to provide clearer instructions to ensure use of the MailHog WebUI, in which there is a  clickable link available in the plain text view provided. I've tested both 32bit and 64bit Mailhog executables on Win 7 and have confirmed behaviour is identical between the two versions.\r\n\r\nI'll write up my changes to Contributing.md later today and raise a PR.\r\n"}, {"classified_as": "bug", "text": "I have built a video calling app in Flutter using the Agora SDK.
