[{"classified_as": "bug", "text": "i was asked by the vs code team to move this bug report upstream to the typescript project.\r\n\r\n- [x] searched existing issues to avoid creating duplicates\r\n- [x] tested using the latest insiders build to make sure issue has not already been fixed\r\n- [x] issue occurs when all extensions are disabled\r\n\r\n\r\n- vscode version: 1.37.1\r\n- vscode insiders version: 1.38.0-insider\r\n- os version: macos mojave 10.14.6\r\n- **typescript version:**  3.7.0-dev.20190828\r\n\r\n**search terms:**\r\n\"vs code\", \"d.ts\", \"unused\", \"editor.showunused\"\r\n\r\nsteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. ensure `editor.showunused` is set to `true` for user, workspace, and folder.\r\n1. create a file with extension `.d.ts`\r\n1. add valid import statement such as\r\n```import { user } from 'types/users';```\r\n\r\n**actual behavior**: import statement is not faded even though it hasn't been used.\r\n**expected behavior**: import statement should be faded out as per setting.\r\n\r\nadditional steps:\r\n\r\n1. convert filename to have only the `.ts` extension (drop the `.d`)\r\nnote: import line is dimmed as expected. the issue appears to only be affected by `.d.ts` files.\r\n\r\n**related issues:**\r\npossibly:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/typescript/issues/32196\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/typescript/issues/30260\r\n"}]
